# Issue: Hardcoded function list in `ollama_lib_about`

The `ollama_lib_about` function contains a hardcoded list of function aliases in the `other_functions` variable.

```bash
local other_functions=$'oag\noap\noapi\nog\nogj\nogs\nogsj\noc\nocj\nocs\nocsj\nom\noma\nomc\nomco\nol\nolj\nola\nomr\nomu\nos\nosj\nop\nopj\noai\noat\noav\noave\oavj\noavc\nolab\nolv\noe\n_debug\n_error\n_exists\n_call_curl\n_is_valid_json\n_is_valid_model\n'
```

This approach is brittle. If function aliases are added, removed, or renamed, this list must be manually updated. Forgetting to do so will lead to an outdated and incorrect list of functions being displayed.

## Recommendation

The list of aliases can be generated dynamically. Since all aliases are defined in the same file, we can `grep` for their definitions. All aliases are short functions that call another function. They are all defined in the `Aliases` section. We can grep for function definitions in that section.

A more robust way would be to find all functions defined in the file and then filter out the ones that are not aliases.

However, a simpler approach would be to find all functions that are defined as `name() { ...; }` and assume they are aliases if they are short.

A better dynamic approach:

```bash
# In ollama_lib_about
# ...
  echo
  echo "Functions:"
  echo

  # Get all declared functions, then filter them
  # This is more robust than a hardcoded list.
  local all_functions
  all_functions=$(declare -F | awk '{print $3}')

  # Filter out private functions (starting with _) and the about function itself
  local public_functions
  public_functions=$(echo "$all_functions" | grep -v -E '^(_|ollama_lib_about)')

  # Maybe separate aliases from main functions
  local main_functions
  main_functions=$(echo "$public_functions" | grep '^ollama_')

  local alias_functions
  alias_functions=$(echo "$public_functions" | grep -v '^ollama_')

  echo "Main Functions:"
  echo "$main_functions" | sort | column

  echo
  echo "Alias Functions:"
  echo "$alias_functions" | sort | column
```

This is just one example. The goal is to avoid the hardcoded list. A simpler implementation would just be to list all public functions together.
