# We need to answer concisely why the sky is blue. Provide brief explanation about Rayleigh scattering. Should be concise.The sky appears blue because molecules and tiny particles in Earth’s atmosphere scatter short‑wavelength (blue) sunlight more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red). This Rayleigh scattering sends blue light in all directions, filling the sky with a blue hue, while the longer‑wavelength colors pass through more directly.

The ocean appears blue because water absorbs light at the red/orange end of the spectrum and scatters the shorter blue wavelengths. The scattered blue light is what we see, giving the sea its blue hue.
