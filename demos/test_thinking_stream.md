We need to answer concisely: Why is sky blue? Provide a short explanation: Rayleigh scattering, shorter blue wavelengths scatter more. So answer concise.Follow guidelines: no irrelevant content.Ok.Because Rayleigh scattering by air molecules preferentially scatters shorter, blue light from the Sun in all directions. The blue wavelengths are diverted toward our eyes, making the sky appear blue.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs longer wavelengths (reds, oranges) more strongly and scatters shorter wavelengths (blues) more efficiently. Sunlight that enters the water is filtered; the predominantly blue component is scattered back to our eyes, giving the sea its blue appearance.
