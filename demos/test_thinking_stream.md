# The user asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." So we need concise answer. Probably mention Rayleigh scattering: shorter wavelengths scatter. So answer: due to Rayleigh scattering by gases, blue is scattered. Just say that.Because air molecules scatter more short‑wavelength (blue) light than long‑wavelength (red) light. This Rayleigh scattering redirects the sun’s blue light in all directions, making the sky appear blue during the day.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs longer‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light and lets shorter‑wavelength (blue) light scatter and reflect back to us. The few molecules and tiny particles in the water scatter blue light forward (Rayleigh scattering), so most of the visible light that reaches our eyes is blue.
