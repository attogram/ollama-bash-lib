# The user asks a simple factual question: Why is the sky blue? They want a concise answer. The conversation is normal. There's no policy issues. We can answer.Because sunlight is scattered by the Earth's atmosphere. Shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered in all directions by air molecules far more efficiently than longer (red) wavelengths, so the sky appears blue to our eyes.

Because water absorbs longerâ€‘wavelength light (reds, oranges, and greys) more than blue, so the remaining scattered light we see is predominantly blue.
