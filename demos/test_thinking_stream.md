# The user wants a concise answer: why is sky blue? So explain Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths scattered more, etc. Provide concise.The sky appears blue because molecules and tiny particles in Earth’s atmosphere scatter sunlight. Short‑wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered about 10 × more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red) due to Rayleigh scattering (intensity ∝ 1/λ⁴). Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet and some violet is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, so the scattered light we see is dominantly blue.

Because water absorbs longer‑wavelength (red, orange, yellow) light more strongly than shorter‑wavelength light, the blue part of sunlight scatters and reaches our eyes in large amounts. The scattering of the remaining blue light makes the ocean look blue.
