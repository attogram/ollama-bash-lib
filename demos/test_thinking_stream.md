# The user: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." Provide concise explanation: Rayleigh scattering: shorter blue wavelengths scatter more.So answer in concise manner. No further elaboration. Let's answer: The atmosphere scatters sunlight; blue light (shorter wavelength) scatters more due to Rayleigh scattering, making sky appear blue.We can keep it brief.Because sunlight is scattered by air molecules, and Rayleigh scattering favors short‑wavelength (blue) light. The blue component is dispersed in all directions, so the sky looks blue.

The ocean appears blue because water absorbs longer‑wavelength (red, orange) light more efficiently than shorter‑wavelength (blue) light. The remaining blue light is scattered back to our eyes, and some of it is also reflected from the sky, giving the sea its characteristic color.
