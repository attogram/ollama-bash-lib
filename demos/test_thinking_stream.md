# User asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." They want a concise answer. So respond succinctly. Probably explain Rayleigh scattering. Use no extra fluff.Because molecules in the air scatter sunlight. Short‑wavelength blue light is scattered in every direction more strongly than longer wavelengths, so the sky appears blue.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs longer‑wavelength light (red, orange) more than shorter wavelengths (blue). The little red light that does reach the surface is scattered by molecules and small particles, and our eyes perceive the remaining blue light coming back to us.
