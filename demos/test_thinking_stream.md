# The user asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise."We need to answer concisely. Provide explanation: Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths scatter more, etc. Probably one or two sentences. Should be short.The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth’s atmosphere scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths of sunlight more efficiently than longer (red) wavelengths—a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, giving the sky its characteristic color.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs light most strongly at the red → yellow wavelengths and transmits/ scatters the shorter blue wavelengths. Sunlight that penetrates the water is thus dominated by blue light, and the surface also reflects the blue sky, reinforcing the color.
