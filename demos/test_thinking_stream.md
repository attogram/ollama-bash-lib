# The user asks a simple straightforward question: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." So answer concisely: Blue due to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by atmosphere; shorter wavelengths scatter more. Provide short answer. Probably 1-2 sentences.The sky appears blue because Earth’s atmosphere scatters shorter‑wavelength (blue) light more efficiently than longer wavelengths. When sunlight hits air molecules, Rayleigh scattering redirects a lot of blue light in all directions, making the sky look blue during daylight.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs longer (red‑orange) wavelengths of sunlight while scattering and transmitting shorter (blue‑green) wavelengths. Additionally, the water’s surface reflects the blue sky, enhancing the effect. The combined selective absorption and scattering make the sea appear blue.
