# User asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." Provide concise answer.We should answer straightforward.Provide concise answer: Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths (blue) scattered more. Also mention human perception.Let's produce final.The sky appears blue because Earth’s atmosphere scatters sunlight. Short‑wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered about 10 × more efficiently than longer‑wavelength red light due to Rayleigh scattering (scattering intensity ∝ 1/λ⁴). Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet and the upper atmosphere absorbs much of the violet, so the scattered light we see is predominately blue.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs colors at the red/infrared end of the spectrum and reflects/transmits the shorter blue wavelengths. Scattering of sunlight in the water—especially Rayleigh scattering that favors blue light—adds to the blue hue we see.
