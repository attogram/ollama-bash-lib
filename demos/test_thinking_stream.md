# The user asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." Provide a concise explanation. Answer plainly about scattering of sunlight, Rayleigh scattering. Should be concise.The sky appears blue because molecules and tiny particles in Earth’s atmosphere scatter short‑wavelength (blue) sunlight more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red). This Rayleigh scattering sends blue light from all directions into our eyes, giving the sky its characteristic color.

The ocean appears blue because water absorbs longer wavelengths (red, orange, yellow) more than shorter ones, and the remaining light—especially blue wavelengths—is scattered by water molecules and small particles. This selective scattering makes the color of reflected sunlight in the water appear blue.
