# The user asks: "Why is the sky blue? Be concise." Provide a concise answer: Rayleigh scattering of shorter wavelengths. Should be short.The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth’s atmosphere scatter short‑wavelength (blue) sunlight much more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red). This Rayleigh scattering sends blue light in all directions, filling our view of the sky.

The ocean looks blue because water absorbs light most strongly at the red end of the spectrum and lets the shorter‑wavelength blue and green light pass through and scatter back to your eyes. Sunlight that penetrates the water is thus dominated by blue wavelengths, giving the sea its characteristic color.
