#### <thinking>
#### We are asked: "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line" The user wants a list. Likely plain text. We should respond with 10 points each on its own line. They didn't ask to number but "1 per line" so we can bullet or numbered. Let's just do bullet points. The content: Some facts: shebang, interactive use, scripting features, builtins, expansion, command substitution, job control, history, arrays, etc. Provide 10 distinct points.

We'll output e.g.:

- Bash stands for "Bourne Again SHell"…
- It supports array variables starting with Bash 4.0
- It has first-class command substitution using $( … )
...

Let's produce 10 lines. Ensure each line is separate.

- Bash is the “Bourne‑Again SHell,” a modern re‑implementation of Steve Bourne’s original shell (sh).  
- The shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env bash` tells a script to run under Bash rather than another shell.  
- Bash includes both interactive mode (REPL) and non‑interactive script execution with features like `set -e` and `set -o pipefail`.  
- It supports associative arrays (key/value maps) as well as indexed arrays, introduced in Bash 4.0.  
- Variable expansion uses `${var}` syntax, with support for default values `${var:-default}` and substring operations `${var:offset:length}`.  
- Command substitution can be done with backticks or `$()`—the latter is preferred for readability and nesting.  
- Bash offers brace expansion, e.g., `echo a{b,c}d` prints `abd acd`, useful for generating filenames.  
- Job control (`Ctrl‑Z`, `fg`, `bg`, `jobs`) lets you suspend and resume processes directly from the shell prompt.  
- Bash’s `read` built‑in supports `-p` prompts and `-s` silent input (e.g., for passwords).  
- The history feature (`history`, `!<number>`) records commands, and can be configured with `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILE` to persist across sessions.
