User wants "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line". That is straightforward. We should list 10 things about bash. Provide a line per item. Maybe bullet list or numbers separate lines. Probably each line with a number or just plain items. They didn't specify format: just 10 things. Could be facts or features. I need to respond with exactly 10 lines. Let's do:

1. Bash is the GNU Bourne-Again SHell, a popular Unix shell.
2. ...

Make sure each line unique. Provide concise descriptions. Let's do numbering. Ensure every line counts. Ensure no extra explanation.

Ok.

1. Bash is the GNU Bourne-Again SHell, a ubiquitous command language for Unix-like systems.  
2. It provides command-line editing, autocomplete, and job control built into the terminal.  
3. Bash supports scripting constructs such as loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays.  
4. It uses globbing (wildcards) for pattern matching file names like `*.txt` or `file[0-9].c`.  
5. The `history` command allows users to recall, edit, and re-execute previously typed commands.  
6. Bash variable assignments can be exported to subprocesses with `export VAR=value`.  
7. It offers brace expansion, e.g., `{a,b,c}.txt` expands to `a.txt b.txt c.txt`.  
8. Bash reads initialization files (`.bashrc`, `.profile`) on startup to configure environment.  
9. It includes arithmetic expansion `$(( expression ))` for evaluating mathematical expressions.  
10. Bash scripts can be made executable with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) and run directly.
