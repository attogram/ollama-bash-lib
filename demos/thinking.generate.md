1. Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell,” a modern successor to the original Bourne shell.  
2. It is the default login shell on most GNU/Linux distributions and macOS.  
3. Bash supports command-line editing with Emacs‑ and vi‑style keybindings.  
4. It includes powerful features like command history, aliasing, and programmable completion.  
5. Bash allows scripting with variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays.  
6. It provides built‑in arithmetic expansion for integer calculations.  
7. Bash can execute pipelines, redirect input/output, and combine commands with &&, ||, and ;.  
8. It supports process substitution (`<(command)` and `>(command)`) and “here‑documents.”  
9. Bash can load configuration from `/etc/profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, and other startup files.  
10. Its extensibility includes custom prompts (`PS1`), shell options (`set -o`), and user‑defined completion functions.
