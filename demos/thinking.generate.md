1. Bash is the default command‚Äêline shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.  
2. It supports command history, allowing users to navigate and reuse previous commands with the up/down arrow keys.  
3. Bash permits variable assignment without spaces (`VAR=value`) and variable expansion with `${}` or `$`.  
4. It features pathname globbing (`*.txt`, `file[1-3]`) for pattern matching.  
5. Bash includes a powerful array type, which can be declared with `arr=(one two three)` and accessed with `arr[0]`.  
6. It supports control structures such as `if`, `for`, `while`, and `until`, enabling script logic.  
7. Bash can perform process substitution (`< <(command)`) and named pipes (using `mkfifo`).  
8. The `exec` builtin can replace the current shell with another program, or redirect file descriptors.  
9. Bash scripts can be made executable by adding a shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the top.  
10. Its `read` builtin can capture user input, with options like `-p` to prompt and `-s` for silent (password) input.
