# <thinking>
# User wants: "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line". So produce a list of 10 items, each on separate line. They did not want headings or numbering? It says 1 per line, so maybe just each line with a statement? Might include numbering, but that would be extra text. Better to just each line separate without numbering. Provide concise statements about Bash. Ok.

Bash is the standard default shell on most Linux distributions.  
It supports both imperative programming and shell scripting.  
Bash has built‑in support for job control (background/foreground jobs).  
It provides command substitution using backticks or $(…​).  
Bash automatically expands wildcards in file names (globbing).  
It offers associative arrays, indexed arrays, and string manipulation.  
Bash can read input from pipelines, command substitution, or heredocs.  
It allows pattern matching with case statements and extended glob patterns.  
Bash includes arithmetic evaluation with $((…​)).  
It supports custom prompts and configurable command history.
