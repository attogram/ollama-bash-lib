- Bash is the GNU Project’s Bourne‑Again SHell, a Unix shell and command‑language interpreter.  
- It is the default login shell on most Linux distributions and macOS (prior to Catalina).  
- Bash supports both interactive use and scripting, allowing users to automate tasks.  
- It includes features like command history, tab completion, and programmable completion.  
- Bash implements arrays and associative arrays for handling collections of data.  
- It provides extensive parameter expansion and substitution capabilities.  
- Bash can execute pipelines and supports process substitution (`<(…)` and `>(…)`).  
- It offers shell functions, aliases, and built‑in commands for extending functionality.  
- Bash scripts can be made portable by using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the shebang line.  
- Bash includes options for strict error handling, such as `set -e`, `set -u`, and `set -o pipefail`.
