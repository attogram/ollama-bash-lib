# <thinking>
# The user: "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line". They want a list of 10 items about Bash. No special constraints. Provide each on a separate line. Should be clear. Possibly bullet points, but they said 1 per line. So just each line separate.

Let's keep it succinct: can be features, commands, facts. Provide the list. No extra formatting? Probably it's fine.

Write:

1. Bash stands for "Bourne Again SHell".
2. It's the default shell on many Linux distributions.
3. It supports command history and auto-completion.
4. It can execute scripts and run commands.
5. It provides variables, arrays, and associative arrays.
6. It supports globbing and pathname expansion.
7. It has built-in arithmetic evaluation.
8. It can run external programs.
9. It features command chaining with &&, ||, and ;.
10. It can be extended with functions and command substitution.

That's 10 lines. Ensure each is separate line, not bullet formatting unless required. They said 1 per line so just plain text lines. Provide final answer.

Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell”.  
It’s the default shell on most Linux and many macOS systems.  
It supports command history and tab‑based auto‑completion.  
You can write and execute Bash scripts to automate tasks.  
Variables, arrays, and associative arrays can be defined and manipulated.  
Pathname expansion (globbing) allows flexible file matching.  
Arithmetic can be performed with $((…)) syntax.  
Bash can invoke and chain any external program.  
Command chaining operators (&&, ||, ;) enable flow control.  
Functions and command substitution (`` and $(…)) extend its scripting power.
