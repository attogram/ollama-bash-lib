#### The user wants a list of 10 things about bash, one per line. That's straightforward. Provide 10 items, each bullet or just a line. Probably short factual statements. Ensure each line separate.

- Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default command‑line interpreter for most Linux distributions.  
- It is an interactive shell that also serves as a powerful scripting language.  
- Bash supports command history, tab completion, and programmable completion.  
- It provides arithmetic expansion, allowing calculations directly in the shell.  
- Bash includes control structures like if/else, for, while, until, and case for scripting logic.  
- It offers job control features to run, suspend, and manage background processes.  
- Bash can read and execute commands from startup files such as ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile.  
- It supports input/output redirection, pipelines, and process substitution.  
- Bash includes built‑in commands (e.g., cd, echo, read, printf) that run without launching external programs.  
- Bash is POSIX‑compatible, yet adds many extensions and enhancements beyond the POSIX shell standard.
