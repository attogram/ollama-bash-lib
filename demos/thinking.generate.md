# <thinking>
# User asks: "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line" They want a list of 10 things about bash. That's allowed. We comply. We need 10 items, each one per line. Provide plain text.

We must not mention policy. Just list.

1. Bash stands for "Bourne Again SHell" and is a command processor that typically runs in a text terminal.  
2. It interprets commands entered by the user or read from a script file, providing a powerful shell scripting language.  
3. Bash supports variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and string manipulation directly in the shell.  
4. It offers command substitution (`$(command)` or backticks `` `command` ``) to capture the output of a command into a variable or command argument.  
5. Bash includes pattern matching with globbing (`*`, `?`, `[]`) and extended globbing (enabled via `shopt -s extglob`).  
6. It has builtâ€‘in control structures such as `if`, `case`, `for`, `while`, and `until`, allowing complex conditional logic and loops.  
7. Bash supports functions, which can be defined and called within scripts or interactively.  
8. The `read` builtin lets Bash pause and wait for user input, optionally with a prompt or silent password entry.  
9. Bash can perform job control; it can run processes in the background (`&`) and bring them to the foreground with `fg`.  
10. The `trap` builtin can catch signals (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) to execute cleanup code when a script or shell session exits or is interrupted.
