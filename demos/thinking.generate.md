# Need to list 10 things about Bash, each on separate line. Keep simple, but can be varied. Not too short? Just list. No extra commentary. Provide 10 lines.

1. Bash stands for "Bourne Again Shell," a Unix shell and command language.  
2. It is the default login shell on many Linux distributions and macOS.  
3. Bash supports scripting features like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.  
4. It includes command history and lineâ€‘editing capabilities via GNU Readline.  
5. Bash can perform filename globbing (wildcards) and brace expansion.  
6. It has an associative array type (hash table) introduced in Bash 4.0.  
7. Bash allows process substitution, enabling the output of one command to be used as a file input for another.  
8. It supports arithmetic evaluation using `$(( ... ))` syntax.  
9. Bash can execute external programs and pipe their output between commands.  
10. You can customize Bash with environment files like `.bashrc`, `.profile`, and `.bash_profile`.
