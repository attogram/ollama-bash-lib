The user asks: "list 10 things about bash, 1 per line". They want a list of 10 things about bash, each on its own line. It's a straightforward request. No disallowed content. Provide a list. Could be features, facts, commands, etc. Probably something like: "Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell", "It's the default shell on many Linux", etc. Provide exactly 10 lines, each a single item about bash. Probably no extra commentary.

We should comply.

Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell,” a successor to the original Bourne shell (sh).  
It is the default command‑line interpreter on most GNU/Linux distributions.  
Bash supports command line editing, history, and tab‑completion for faster typing.  
It includes built‑in scripting constructs like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals, and functions.  
Bash can execute both built‑in commands and external programs located in the system’s `$PATH`.  
It provides powerful redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`, `2>`, `&>`).  
Arrays and associative arrays are native data structures in Bash scripts.  
Bash features brace expansion, allowing quick generation of multiple strings (e.g., `file{1..5}.txt`).  
It supports job control, enabling background execution (`&`) and job manipulation (`bg`, `fg`, `jobs`).  
Bash can be customized with a `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to set aliases, environment variables, and prompt appearance.
