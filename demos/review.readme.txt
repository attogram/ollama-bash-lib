 This text is a description of a Bash library called Ollama Bash Lib, which provides functions to interact with the Ollama AI system. It includes various utility functions, such as loading and unloading models, chatting with models, estimating the number of tokens in a string, and more. The library requires specific tools and versions of bash, curl, jq, awk, and command, and is licensed under the MIT License.

   Additionally, it provides links to other projects related to AI by the same developer, including Ollama Multirun, Ollama Bash Toolshed, LLM Council, Small Models, and AI Test Zone. Each of these projects has its own GitHub repository with a brief description of what it does.
