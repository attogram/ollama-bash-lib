# Code Review of [ollama_bash_lib.sh](../ollama_bash_lib.sh)

A [demo](../README.md#demos) of [Ollama Bash Lib](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) v0.40.21

## Review

ollama_generate "hermes3:8b" "$task\n\n$(cat "$file")"
```
Here are a few ways you could expand or enhance the Ollama Bash Library:

1. Add more utility functions 
- String manipulation (substring, split, join etc)
- Text processing (regex search/replace, counting occurrences) 
- File operations (list files in dir, read file lines)
- Date/time functions (parse dates, get current date)

2. Integrate with external tools
- Connect to databases (SQLite, MySQL etc)  
- Call Python/Ruby/Node.js scripts from Bash
- Use Git for version control
- Integrate terminal based IDEs like nviem

3. Implement additional Ollama interaction
- List loaded models and get their stats
- Get model usage and performance metrics 
- Load/save model snapshots 
- Manage GPU allocation per model
- Connect to Ollama from other languages

4. Add error handling and logging
- Return error codes on failures
- Log commands and outputs to file
- Display progress bars for long running ops
- Trap unexpected errors and exit gracefully

5. Provide configuration options
- Allow setting Ollama env vars in lib 
- Store user preferences across sessions
- Support command line flags to override defaults

6. Integrate with other tools/libraries
- Use jq for JSON processing
- Leverage AWK for text processing
- Call external Bash commands 
- Pipe outputs between utility functions

7. Create more Ollama CLI wrappers
- For common operations like list models, settings
- To replicate various web UI features in command line 

8. Allow dynamic input/output
- Accept input via command line args
- Pipe input/output from/to other tools
- Support multiline string inputs
- Handle file based I/O

9. Add help and documentation
- Provide usage info for each function
- Display example commands 
- Link to external Ollama docs where relevant
- Include a CHANGELOG of changes per release

10. Optimize performance
- Implement caching for frequently used data  
- Batch similar operations for efficiency
- Use parallel processing when beneficial
- Avoid unnecessary disk i/o

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific ideas! I'm happy to provide example code snippets as well.

## Review Debug

ollama_generate "hermes3:8b" "$task\n\n$(cat "$file")"
```

Here are a few key things I noticed in the provided Bash library code:

It provides various functions for interacting with the Ollama CLI tool using Bash scripting. This allows you to write scripts that can send queries to an Ollama model, manage loaded models, view version information and more.

Some of the main categories/functions include:
- Utility functions like estimate_tokens() to estimate the number of tokens in a given text string
- Functions to get/set/display Ollama environment variables 
- Functions to interact with the Ollama API for getting version info, model versions, etc.
- Functions to load and manage Ollama models
- An "about" function to display information about this Bash library itself

The library uses jq for parsing JSON responses from the Ollama CLI.

It also has some utility functions like error handling wrappers around ollama cli commands, and a version checker for this specific library script.

Overall it provides a helpful set of tools for automating interactions with an Ollama instance using bash scripting. The provided code looks well-structured and follows good practices like handling errors and returning exit codes from functions.

Let me know if you have any other specific questions! I tried to give a high-level overview without reproducing any of the actual code.
[DEBUG] ollama_generate: return: 0
