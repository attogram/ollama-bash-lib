# Code Review of [ollama_bash_lib.sh](../ollama_bash_lib.sh)

A [demo](../README.md#demos) of [Ollama Bash Lib](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) v0.41.21


```bash
task="Act as an Expert Software Engineer.

file="../ollama_bash_lib.sh"
ollama_generate "mistral:7b" "$task\n\n$(cat "$file")"
```
 This script is a Bash library for interacting with Ollama, a large language model. The library provides several functions that allow you to perform various tasks such as generating text, estimating the number of tokens in a string, and retrieving information about the Ollama model itself.

Here's a brief overview of some of the key functions:

1. `ollama_init`: Initializes the library by setting up the API endpoint and stream.
2. `ollama_generate`: Generates text based on a provided prompt or input.
3. `estimate_tokens`: Estimates the number of tokens in a given string, which can be helpful for predicting the cost of generating text with Ollama.
4. `ollama_version`, `ollama_version_json`, and `ollama_version_cli`: Retrieve the version information for Ollama.
5. `ollama_lib_about`: Displays information about the Ollama Bash Lib, including its name, version, URL, license, copyright, and a list of available functions.

The library uses environment variables to store configuration options such as the API endpoint, stream, and debug mode. You can set these environment variables manually or by running the `ollama_init` function with the appropriate arguments.

Here's an example of how you might use this script to generate text with Ollama:

```bash
# Set environment variables for Ollama API and stream
export OLLAMA_API="http://localhost:8000"
export OLLAMA_STREAM="/dev/null"

# Initialize the library
source ollama_lib.sh
ollama_init

# Generate some text based on a prompt
prompt="Write a short story about a cat and a hat."
response=$(ollama_generate "$prompt")
echo $response
```
