# Code Review of [ollama_bash_lib.sh](../ollama_bash_lib.sh)

A [demo](../README.md#demos) of [Ollama Bash Lib](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) v0.39.6

## Review


```bash
prompt="Act as an expert Software Engineer.
Do a full Code Review of this script:

$(cat "../ollama_bash_lib.sh")"
ollama_generate "cogito:3b" "$prompt"
```
```
This script is a Bash library for interacting with the Ollama application. It provides various functions for working with Ollama and can be used in other Bash scripts.

Here's a breakdown of some key functions:

1. `ollama_vars()`: Displays all environment variables related to Ollama.
2. `ollama_version()`: Returns the version number of the Ollama application.
3. `ollama_version_json()`: Returns the version information as JSON.
4. `ollama_version_cli()`: Returns the version information using the CLI command.
5. `estimate_tokens()`: Estimates the number of tokens in a given string, considering various factors like word count, character count, byte count, and more.

Some other notable functions include:

1. `ollama_lib_about()`: Provides information about the Bash library itself.
2. `ollama_lib_version()`: Returns the version of the Bash library.
3. Various Ollama-specific functions like loading models, running queries, etc.

To use this library in your scripts, you can source it using:

```bash
source ollama-lib.sh
```

Then you can call any of the provided functions as needed.

The script seems to be well-structured with modular functions and good error handling. It also provides verbose output for debugging purposes when requested.

## Review Debug


```bash
OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG=1 ollama_generate "cogito:3b" "$prompt"
```
```
[DEBUG] ollama_generate: [cogito:3b] [Act as an expert Software Engineer.

I can see that you've shared a Bash script with various utility functions for interacting with the Ollama AI system. Here are some key points about this script:

1. **Purpose**: This script appears to be part of a larger project aimed at creating an interface or library for interacting with the Ollama AI system. It contains numerous utility functions, some of which deal with:
   - Version checking
   - Environment variables
   - Estimating token counts in strings
   - Handling different types of input/output

2. **Library Functions**: The script includes several Bash library functions that provide a consistent interface for interacting with Ollama:

```bash
ollama_version() {
    ollama_api_get "/api/version"
}

ollama_vars() {
    echo "OLLAMA_DEBUG: $OLLAMA_DEBUG"
}
```

3. **Error Handling**: The script uses standard Bash error handling practices, such as checking return values of commands.

4. **Input Processing**: Functions like `estimate_tokens` handle both piped input and file input, making the script more versatile.

5. **Debugging Support**: There are various debug-related functions that can help in troubleshooting:

```bash
ollama_debug() {
    echo "DEBUG: $1"
}
```

6. **Version Management**: The script includes functions for checking the version of Ollama:

```bash
ollama_version_cli()
{
    ollama --version
}
```

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this script in more detail?
[DEBUG] ollama_generate: return: 0
```
