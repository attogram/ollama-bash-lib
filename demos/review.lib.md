## Review

This is a collection of Bash scripts for interacting with Ollama, an AI model and library. The scripts cover various functionalities such as managing Ollama instances, retrieving information about the application version, fetching list of available prompts, estimating token count in a given text or string, and providing details about the Ollama Bash Lib itself.

Here's a brief overview of some functions:

1. `estimate_tokens`: Estimates the number of tokens in a given string (text, file, or piped input) with an optional error range.
2. `ollama_lib_about`: Displays information about Ollama Bash Lib, including version, URL, license, and available functions using `compgen`.
3. `ollama_lib_version`: Outputs the semantic version number of Ollama Bash Lib.

You can execute these scripts in your terminal by sourcing the script file (e.g., `. $script_name`) or directly running them as executable files. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the functions and their dependencies.

The provided text is a collection of Bash commands and functions that form a library for interacting with an application called Ollama. This library, referred to as `OLLAMA_LIB`, offers various functionalities such as version retrieval, information about the library itself, usage examples, token estimation, and more.

Here's a brief overview of some key functions:

1. **Version Information**:
   - `ollama_version`: Gets Ollama application version in JSON format using an API call.
   - `ollama_version_json`: Retrieves the same version in JSON format without conversion.
   - `ollama_version_cli`: Obtains Ollama application version from CLI command.

2. **Token Estimation**:
   - `estimate_tokens`: Estimates the number of tokens in a given string, optionally providing an error range with verbose output based on user input.

3. **Ollama Application Information**:
   - `ollama_lib_about`: Displays information about the OLLAMA_LIB Bash library itself, including name, version, URL, license, copyright, and debugging status. It also lists available functions using `compgen`.

4. **Library Version**:
   - `ollama_lib_version`: Simply prints the current version of the OLLAMA_LIB Bash library.

These functions can be invoked individually or combined to provide comprehensive interaction with the Ollama application through a Bash-based interface.
