## Review

$(cat "../ollama_bash_lib.sh")"
ollama_generate "llava-llama3:8b" "$prompt"
```
```
This is a set of bash functions that interact with the Ollama Bash Library. The library provides various functions for interacting with Ollama, including estimating token counts in text input.

The `ollama_` prefix indicates that these are functions specific to the Ollama Bash Library. Each function starts with an echo statement followed by the name of the function and its description. For example, `ollama_lib_version` is a function that outputs the semantic version number of the library. The rest of the `ollama_` functions provide more specific functions for interacting with the Ollama Bash Library.

For instance, `estimate_tokens` is a function that takes in a string and calculates the estimate range of tokens (words or bytes) based on the input text. It returns the estimated number of tokens, along with the error range, which helps to give an approximate idea about the token count. This can be used for various purposes like estimating the number of words in a document or file.

Similarly, `about` function provides information about the library itself such as its name and version.

This set of functions is designed to make it easy for the user to interact with the Ollama Bash Library using the power of bash scripting language.

## Review Debug


```bash
OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 ollama_generate "llava-llama3:8b" "$prompt"
```
```
This code defines a Bash library for interacting with Ollama. The functions defined in the library include estimating the number of tokens in a string (using `estimate_tokens`), about the Ollama Bash Lib (with `ollama_lib_about`), and the version of the Ollama Bash Lib (with `ollama_lib_version`). The `compgen` command is used to list the functions defined in the library, which can be output by using the `-A` flag. The version of the Ollama Bash Lib is also output to stdout.
