This is a Bash script that provides various functions to interact with Ollama, an open-source machine learning platform. The script is divided into several sections, each containing related commands or utilities:

1. **Ollama Commands**:
   - `ollama_version`: Get the current version of Ollama.
   - `ollama_app_version`: Retrieve the Ollama application version in text and JSON formats.
   - `ollama_app_version_cli`: Display the Ollama application version using the command-line interface.

2. **Token Estimation**:
   - `estimate_tokens`: Estimate the number of tokens in a given string, providing an error range if requested.

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `ollama_lib_about`: Display information about the Ollama Bash Library, including its name, version, and documentation links.
   - `ollama_lib_version`: Print the semantic version number of the Ollama Bash Library.

The script also includes a message indicating that compgen (a utility for function completion) is used to list available functions within the Ollama Bash Library.

To use these functions, simply invoke their respective commands in your terminal or integrate them into your scripts as needed. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and paths set up correctly for each command to work properly.
