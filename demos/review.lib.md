## Review


```bash
prompt="Act as an expert Software Engineer.
Do a full Code Review of this script:

$(cat "../ollama_bash_lib.sh")"
ollama_generate "mistral:7b-instruct" "$prompt"
```
```
 This Bash script is a library for interacting with an Ollama API. It defines several functions for debugging, error handling, JSON escaping and sanitization, making HTTP requests to the Ollama API, and generating completions. Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. The script sets several variables related to the library, including its name, version, URL, license, copyright, API URL, debug mode, message array, and return values for success and error.

2. Internal functions include `debug`, `error`, `json_clean`, and `json_sanitize`. These are used for debugging messages, error handling, JSON escaping, and sanitizing JSON strings, respectively.

3. API functions include `ollama_api_get`, `ollama_api_post`, and `ollama_api_ping`. These are used to make GET, POST, and ping requests to the Ollama API, respectively.

4. Generate functions include `ollama_generate_json`, `ollama_generate_stream_json`, `ollama_generate`, `ollama_generate_stream`, `ollama_messages`, `ollama_message_add`, `ollama_messages_clear`, and `ollama_messages_count`. These are used to generate completions as JSON, streaming JSON, text, or streaming text. They also manage the message array for storing messages during a conversation.

5. There are some additional functions for handling messages, including `ollama_chat_json`, `ollama_chat`, `ollama_chat_stream_json`, and `ollama_chat_stream`. These are used to initiate and manage conversations with the Ollama API.

6. The script also includes some utility functions such as `estimate_tokens` for estimating the number of tokens in a string.

7. Lastly, there are some library-specific functions like `ollama_lib_about`, which provides information about the library, and `ollama_lib_version`, which returns the version of the library.

Overall, this script appears well-organized and easy to understand. However, here are a few suggestions for improvements:

1. Consider adding type definitions or comments for variables and functions to make it easier for others to understand the purpose and usage of each element.
2. The script uses bash 4+ features such as array subscripting with `${array[@]}` and process substitution with `$(command)`. Make sure these features are supported in your target environment.
3. The script does not handle errors gracefully in some places, especially when using external commands like `jq`, `wc`, or `sed`. Consider adding error checking and handling for these situations to prevent unexpected behavior.
4. Consider using a linter such as ShellCheck (https://www.shellcheck.net/) to catch common mistakes and improve the overall quality of your script.
5. If possible, consider moving some functionality into separate files or modules to make the script more modular and easier to maintain.

Overall, this is a good starting point for interacting with an Ollama API using Bash. With some improvements, it could become a useful library for others to build upon.

 This Bash script is a library for interacting with an Ollama API. It defines various functions for debugging, error handling, JSON manipulation, API calls, and chat functionality. Here's a brief overview of the code:

1. The script initializes some variables such as the name, version, URL, license, copyright, API URL, debug mode, message array, and return values.

2. There are several internal functions for debugging (`debug`), error handling (`error`), cleaning a string for JSON use (`json_clean`), sanitizing a string for jq use (`json_sanitize`), and making API calls (`ollama_api_get`, `ollama_api_post`, `ollama_api_ping`).

3. The API functions handle GET, POST, and ping requests to the Ollama API. They utilize the cURL command to make these requests.

4. The generate functions are used for generating chat responses from the Ollama API. There are versions that return JSON (`ollama_generate_json`, `ollama_generate_stream_json`) and text (`ollama_generate`, `ollama_generate_stream`).

5. There are message-related functions for managing messages, such as getting all messages (`messages`), adding a message (`messages_add`), clearing all messages (`messages_clear`), and counting the number of messages (`messages_count`).

6. The chat-related functions handle different ways of requesting a chat completion: JSON version (`ollama_chat_json`), text version (`ollama_chat`), streaming JSON version (`ollama_chat_stream_json`), and streaming text version (`ollama_chat_stream`).

7. There are list functions for getting all available models in different formats: CLI version (`ollama_list`), JSON version (`ollama_list_json`), Bash array version (`ollama_list_array`), and getting a random model (`ollama_model_random`).

8. There are functions for unloading a model from memory (`ollama_model_unload`) and checking if Ollama is installed on the local system (`ollama_installed`).

9. The script also includes functions for showing model information in text (`ollama_show`) and JSON format (`ollama_show_json`), as well as getting Ollama's environment variables (`ollama_vars`), version (`ollama_version`, `ollama_version_json`, `ollama_version_cli`), and utility functions for estimating the number of tokens in a string (`estimate_tokens`).

10. Lastly, there are functions for about information on Ollama Bash Lib (`ollama_lib_about`) and its version (`ollama_lib_version`).

Overall, this script is well-organized and easy to read. However, there are a few minor issues:

1. There seems to be a typo in the `ollama_generate_stream_json` function where it turns off streaming after the chat request has already been made. This might cause unexpected behavior.

2. The script uses `sed` for some string manipulation, but it would be more idiomatic to use `cut`, `awk`, or parameter expansion when appropriate (e.g., removing the last slash in the `json` variable construction).

3. There are a few commented-out TODO items that could benefit from attention, such as replacing control characters instead of removing them in the `json_sanitize` function.

4. Some functions use return values for error handling, but others use global variables (e.g., `error` and `debug`). It would be more consistent to use either return values or global variables throughout the script.

5. The script could benefit from better documentation of each function's purpose and usage in comments at the beginning of the function definitions. This would make it easier for others to understand how to use the library.

6. Finally, consider using a consistent indentation style across the entire script for improved readability.
[DEBUG] ollama_generate: return: 0
```
