# Code Review – `ollama-bash-lib.sh`

Below is a detailed review of the *Ollama Bash Library* script.  
It is aimed at **Bash v3.2**+ (the minimum required version on macOS 10.15 and early Linux distros) and attempts to keep the library portable, well‑documented, and idiomatic.  Where I found non‑portable bashisms, potential bugs, or room for improvement, I have added a comment and, when appropriate, a short patch snippet.

> ⚠️ **Quick note:** The script is large – for a complete audit it would take a long time.  The review covers the most critical pieces that affect *Bash‑compatibility, error‑handling, and security.*  If you would like a deeper dive on a particular section, feel free to ask!

---

## 1.  Compatibility with Bash 3.2+

| Feature | Bash 3.2 support | Issue | Fix / Comment |
|---------|------------------|-------|---------------|
| **Process Substitution** (`< <(...)` or `>(...)`) | ✔ | The script uses them in several places (e.g. `ollama_list_array`, `ollama_generate_stream` etc.). Bash 3.2 supports this – no change required. | ✅ |
| **Arrays** (`declare -a / ARR=()`) | ✔ | All array usage (`OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES`, `OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_*`) is fine. | ✅ |
| **`[[ ... ]]` with regex** | ✔ | Bash 3.2’s regex engine supports the patterns used in `_is_valid_url` and `_is_valid_model`. | ✅ |
| **Arithmetic evaluation `(( ... ))`** | ✔ | Used widely (`_debug`, `_call_curl`, `_ollama_payload_generate`, etc.). | ✅ |
| **`command -v`** | ✔ | Used in `_exists`. | ✅ |
| **`printf '%s' "$1"`** | ✔ | Used to avoid subshells and keep I/O safe. | ✅ |
| **Here‑string `<<<`** | ✔ | `ollama_list_array` uses `<<<`. Bash 3.2 supports this. | ✅ |

Only *minor* issues appear in terms of compatibility – the code does not use any syntax that requires Bash 4+.  

> **TIP:** If your target platform is older than Bash 3.2, you may need to replace the array syntax with POSIX `set`/`shift` parsing or a bash‑4+ test.

---

## 2.  Security & Redaction

* **Redaction** is performed by `_redact` – it only checks `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY`.  
  *If you expose other secrets (e.g. `OLLAMA_AUTH`, `OLLAMA_TILDE`), you might want to broaden the check.*  
  A quick helper (`_get_redacted_var`) already does partial redaction for environment variables.

* **Safe‑mode** disables `_debug`, `_eval`, and curl calls that send API keys.  Good.

---

## 3.  Error Handling & Exit Codes

| Function | Current behaviour | Observed problems | Suggested fix |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `_is_valid_json` | Returns exit‑code matched to jq's status. | If jq is missing, the error is lost – the function merely returns `1` silently. | Add a clear error: `if ! _exists jq; then _error ...; return 1; fi` (already present). |
| `_call_curl` | Returns curl exit code or `1` on HTTP error. | The HTTP status is only “>=400”; if curl returns `0` but the body contains an error object, that will be considered success – though the caller usually validates with `_is_valid_json`. | Suggest adding an optional `--fail http_code` check and logging error details. |
| `ollama_generate_*` | Errors are returned through global `OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM`. | The `ollama_generate_stream` function writes to stderr via a *process substitution* but never checks the exit status of the inner pipeline. | Explicitly capture `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` after the pipeline.  (The code already does that in `ollama_generate_stream` – good) |
| `ollama_eval` | Uses `timeout` if available, otherwise `bash -n` | If `timeout` exits with exit‑code 124 (timeout), we treat it as an error regardless. | Fine – but consider using `${?}` to avoid swallowing non‑zero status. |

> **General recommendation:** Ensure every function consistently returns `0` on success, any non‑zero on error.  Some helper functions (e.g. `ollama_app_installed`) return the result of `_exists` directly which can be `0` or `1` – this is fine.

---

## 4.  Parameter & Argument Validation

* Almost every public API offers a `-h|--help` flag, but **no parameter validation** is performed against the *type* or *length* of arguments after the help path.  
  The majority of functions do a `[[ -z "$1" ]]` check – good.  
  However, many functions that expect JSON (`ollama_generate_json`, `ollama_chat_json`, etc.) blindly pipe into `jq` *without escaping special characters* in the prompt.  If the prompt contains newlines or quotes, the `jq -c` encoding may still work because `jq` escapes them properly, but you lose the original formatting when debugging.  
  For safety, prefer:

  ```bash
  json_payload=$(jq -c -n --arg prompt "$prompt" '{"prompt":$prompt}')
  ```

* In `ollama_app_turbo`, if **no mode is supplied**, the function silently returns without error but also does nothing.  
  Consider treating the lack of mode as an error to avoid silent failures.

---

## 5.  Specific Function Critiques

### `_ollama_thinking_stream`

```bash
if read -r -n 1 chunk && [[ -n "$chunk" ]]; then
  ...
  cat >&2
  printf "\n# </thinking>\n\n" >&2
fi
```

*Reads only one character (`-n 1`) then forwards the rest.*  
While this works for a pipe that emits a single line at a time (as with `ollama_generate_json` streaming output), it silently discards any initial *whitespace* preceding the first character of the first chunk.  
**Fix (if you need that whitespace)**:

```bash
local first_char second_part
if read -r -n 1 first_char && IFS= read -r -d '' second_part; then
  printf "# <thinking>\n# %s%s\n# </thinking>\n\n" "$first_char" "$second_part"
fi
```

*Note:* `read -d ''` reads until EOF in Bash ≥ 3.2.

### `_is_valid_json`

The function currently accepts any `jq` exit code as valid JSON if it is not `0`.  
While this is technically correct for checking validity, the documentation says “return 0 on success, 1 or higher if not valid”.  
The extensive `case` mapping is fine, but the function would be simpler if it only returned `0` for a truthy result (i.e. JSON that is not `"false"` or `"null"`).  
In the current library, the *truthy* result is important for `ollama_generate_json`, which expects a *complete* JSON object.

### `ollama_app_turbo`

```
export OLLAMA_HOST="$host_api"
export OLLAMA_LIB_API="$host_api"
```

The library uses **two** environment variables to track the API endpoint.  
When Turbo Mode is enabled, both are set to `https://ollama.com`.  When disabled, they are reset to the local default.  
This is fine but can be confusing for downstream scripts that might use either variable. It would be clearer to expose only one public variable (`OLLAMA_HOST`) and **document** that it is the authoritative source.

### `ollama_eval`

The function interacts with the user via `read -r permission`.  
In *non‑interactive* contexts (e.g. CI pipelines), this will block.  
Add a quick check:

```bash
if [[ -t 0 ]]; then
  read -r permission
else
  _debug "Non‑interactive: defaulting to 'eval y'?" # or abort
fi
```

### `ollama_list_array`

The array is populated line by line via `< <(...)`.  
Bash 3.2 *does* support process substitution, but the outer `while` loop doesn’t handle `IFS=' '` inside the loop.  
If a model name contains spaces, it will be split incorrectly.  
Since model names never contain spaces (they’re valid identifiers), this is currently safe.

---

## 6.  Suggested Enhancements

Below are a few lightweight patches that improve robustness without breaking existing behaviour.

### 6.1  Avoiding `null` in `ollama_tools_run`

```bash
# Old:
if [[ -z "$tool_args_str" ]] || [[ "$tool_args_str" == "null" ]]; then
    tool_args_str="{}"
fi
```

> **Patch:** Add a guard against `"null"` being passed from a JSON array that is empty.

```bash
if [[ -z "$tool_args_str" || "$tool_args_str" == "null" ]]; then
  tool_args_str="{}"
fi
```

### 6.2  Explicit Exit on Missing Command in `ollama_ps_json`

```bash
if ! ollama_api_get '/api/ps'; then
  _error 'ollama_ps_json: ollama_api_get failed'
  return 1
fi
```

> **Patch:** `ollama_api_get` may set `$?` to the HTTP status, but if the request fails due to network error it returns the curl exit code.  The current code already handles that; simply clarify with a comment.

### 6.3  Standardizing Redirection of Errors

Some functions write to stderr but don't explicitly set the exit status of the command that produced the message.  
For example, in `ollama_chat_stream`, after the `while` loop the code uses `exit "${PIPESTATUS[0]}"` – good.  
But the enclosing function has no other error check.  **Add** a single variable:

```bash
{
  # ... pipeline ...
} 2> >( _ollama_thinking_stream )
error_code=$?
```

Then use `error_code` later (already done).

### 6.4  Simplify `ollama_list_array` output

```bash
models=()
while IFS= read -r line; do
  models+=("$line")
done < <(ollama list | awk 'NR>1{print $1}' | sort)

# Instead of echo, just array usage:
printf '%s\n' "${models[@]}"  # one per line
```

It is safer to output one line per model than space‑separated, which can confuse scripts that split on spaces.

### 6.5  Add a “clear cache” helper

Although not requested, a helper to clear the internal arrays without side effects would be handy:

```bash
ollama_lib_reset() {
  OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES=()
  OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_NAME=()
  OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_COMMAND=()
  OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_DEFINITION=()
  OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM=0
  OLLAMA_LIB_DECAY=()
}
```

## 7.  Summary of Findings

| Area | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Bash‑compatibility** | Minor use of `read -n 1`; safe in Bash 3.2 | No change |
| **Array handling** | Appending to arrays OK | Add `local -a` for readability |
| **Error handling** | Mixed error return values | Ensure all public functions return `<0` on success; `1–4` on different failures, `-1` on unexpected |
| **Command existence checks** | Good for most utilities | Add `_exists curl jq` at library init to fail early |
| **Redaction** | Only `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` | Extend `_redact` to cover `OLLAMA_AUTH`, `OLLAMA_TILDE`, etc. |
| **JSON building** | `jq -c -n` constructs payload; good | Add `--compact-output` if not already |
| **Turbo mode** | Two env vars (`OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_LIB_API`) | Keep for backward‑compatibility; document clearly |
| **Interactive prompts** | `ollama_eval` may block in non‑interactive | Detect `-t 0` and exit gracefully or use config |
| **Stream handling** | `_ollama_thinking_stream` prints first char only | Consider handling whitespace; minimal impact otherwise |

## 8.  Quick “Run‑once” Quality Check

```bash
bash -n ollama-bash-lib.sh                # Syntax check (works in Bash 3.2)
./ollama-bash-lib.sh                       # Should source cleanly
```

If you notice any `syntax error: unexpected EOF`, check that the file ends with a newline – Bash 3.2 is picky.

---

## 9.  Final Thoughts

* **The library is already well‑structured** and has a good amount of documentation inline.  
  You already adopt a “safe mode” and a fairly comprehensive error handling strategy – these are strengths.

* A few **edge cases** (interactive prompts, handling of `null` arguments, output tokenization) are worth attention if you plan to use the library in production scripts or CI pipelines.

* The biggest risk is the **missing redaction for other secret variables** and potential blocking in non‑interactive environments, both of which can be fixed with small guard clauses.
