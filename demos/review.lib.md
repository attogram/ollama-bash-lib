Okay, I need to figure out how to help the user with their problem. They provided a bunch of bash code snippets and some messages from it, but they didn't specify what exactly they want. Hmm, let's see.

Looking at the code, there are several functions related to Ollama, like estimating tokens, checking libraries, version calculations, etc. But without knowing the user's specific issue, I can only guess. Maybe they're trying to implement something or have a problem with their code.

Wait, perhaps the user wants me to explain how one of these functions works or help them create a new feature. Alternatively, maybe they want to know if there are any bugs in the provided code.

Since the messages from the user aren't clear, I'll assume they might be trying to implement an Ollama version calculation. For example, when someone runs 'ollama --version', it shows something like "LLVM Version (alpha 62) 10.5", but that's not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe they want a function to estimate the number of tokens in a string using the provided code. Looking at the estimate_tokens function, it seems to do exactly that by counting characters, words, etc., and returns an estimated token count with an error range.

So perhaps the user wants me to explain this function or implement it. Let's think about how to structure the response.

I should start by explaining what the estimate_tokens function does. Then, maybe show how to use it or create an example. Also, I can mention any edge cases or potential issues, like if the string is empty or only contains whitespace.

Another idea: perhaps the user wants to know how to integrate this function into their project. So, I might suggest using it in a script or command where they need token estimation.

I should make sure my explanation is clear and covers the functionality, usage, and any important considerations. Also, since the provided code includes many functions, maybe the user is looking for a specific one to implement or fix an existing bug.

In summary, I'll outline the steps to explain the estimate_tokens function, including how it calculates tokens, provides examples of use cases, and mentions any potential issues to watch out for.
</think>

To address your question about implementing the token estimation functions, here's a step-by-step explanation of the code provided:

1. **Token Estimation Functions**:
   - The `estimate_tokens` function reads a string and calculates an estimated number of tokens based on character count, word count, and average tokens per character.
   - It returns both the estimated token count with an error range in verbose mode.

2. **Purpose**:
   - This function is useful for quickly estimating the number of tokens (words) in a given text by analyzing character composition.

3. **Code Explanation**:
   - The function reads the input string and calculates various metrics like words, characters, bytes.
   - It then estimates token count based on these metrics and returns the result with an error range.

4. **Example Usage**:
   ```bash
   echo "hello world" | estimate_tokens verbose
   ```
   This will output something like:
   ```
   token estimate: 5 (error 10)
   ```

5. **Considerations**:
   - The function assumes that each character typically represents one token, adjusted for common word structures.
   - For better accuracy, consider combining this with other tools or manual analysis.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of these functions in more detail?

Okay, I need to figure out how to replace the given Ollama script with a custom solution using bash and other tools. Let's start by understanding what the original script does.

The user provided an example script that runs several commands: ollama, then reads logs, processes output, runs tests, estimates tokens, and handles version info. The goal is to replace this script with a new one that can handle similar tasks but using different methods.

First, I'll outline what each part of the original script does:

1. Runs "ollama" command.
2. Reads log files for logs.
3. Processes output lines, removing empty ones and processing non-empty ones into tokens.
4. Evaluates test cases based on expected and actual outputs.
5. Estimates the number of tokens in a string using different methods (text, verbose).
6. Handles version information.

Now, I need to translate these steps into bash scripts without relying solely on Ollama. Let's tackle each part one by one.

1. Run "ollama" command: This can be done with ollama --version or just ollama. For simplicity, maybe use ollama.

2. Read log files: I need to read multiple log files and extract relevant lines. Each log file has a different format (root.log, root.log2, etc.), so perhaps create separate commands for each log type or handle them dynamically.

3. Process output into tokens: The user's script processes the output lines, removing empty ones and converting non-empty into tokens with labels. I need to extract these tokens correctly, handling labels and whitespace properly.

4. Evaluate test cases: Compare expected and actual outputs. If all are correct, return success; else, show errors for each line that fails.

5. Estimate tokens: Implement a script using shell commands to count words, characters, bytes, etc., then calculate the range based on these counts.

6. Handle version info: Use ollama --version or write a script to get the version number from the output.

Now, considering the complexity and possible alternatives:

- For log reading, maybe loop through all provided log files, extract lines starting with "ERROR", process each line as per labels.
- Processing tokens can be done using sed commands or by iterating over the processed lines and extracting relevant tokens.
- Estimating tokens could involve counting words, characters, bytes in a sample string to determine the range.
- Version handling can use ollama --version or write a script that runs ollama and captures the output.

Potential challenges:

- Handling multiple log files correctly without duplication.
- Parsing labels accurately when lines have varying structures (e.g., "ERROR: message" vs. "ERROR message").
- Ensuring that all possible test cases are evaluated correctly, especially if some pass and others fail.
- Implementing accurate token counting for estimation, considering different word definitions.

To proceed, I'll create a bash script that:

- Starts by running ollama to get the version information.
- Then reads multiple log files, processes each line according to their labels.
- Extracts tokens into separate arrays based on labels.
- Evaluates test cases and provides output upon success or error messages when any case fails.

I'll structure the script step-by-step, ensuring each part is handled correctly. For example, in the processing step, I can use sed commands to replace empty lines with a placeholder and then count tokens for each label group.

Testing each part as I go would help catch any issues early. Also, considering error handling for log files that might not be found or have invalid formats.

Finally, compiling all these steps into a single bash script that integrates each functionality without relying solely on Ollama, thus providing a self-contained solution.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step-by-step explanation and code implementation:

1. **Run 'ollama' command**: Use `ollama` to execute the script.

2. **Read multiple log files**:
   - For each log file (root.log, root.log2, etc.), read lines starting with "ERROR" or similar messages.
   - Process each line by removing empty lines and extracting tokens based on labels.

3. **Process output into tokens**:
   - Use `sed` commands to replace empty lines and count non-empty lines as tokens per label group.

4. **Evaluate test cases**:
   - Compare expected outputs with actual results for each token.
   - If all pass, display success message; otherwise, show error messages for failed cases.

5. **Estimate tokens using shell functions**:
   - Count words, characters, bytes in a sample string to determine the range.

6. **Handle Ollama version information**:
   - Use `ollama --version` or write a script capturing its output.

Here's the bash script implementing these steps:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Run 'ollama' command and read logs
ollama

# Function to process log lines into tokens per label
process_log_lines() {
    local -i labels=()
    while true; do

            line=" ${line% } "
            # Extract token from label field, default to placeholder
            IFS= read -r line_type <<< "$line"
            case $line_type in
                "ERROR"*) echo "${labels[$line_type]}= Error" ;;
                "WARNING") echo "${labels[$line_type]}= Warning" ;;
                "INFO") echo "${labels[$line_type]}= Info" ;;
                "DEBUG") echo "${labels[$line_type]}= Debug" ;;
            esac
        done
    }
    # Clear labels array after processing all lines
    clear_labels=""
    while true; do
        if [ "$clear_labels" == "" ]; then
            break
        else
            line=$?
            IFS= read -r clear_labels <<< "$line"
            if [[ "$clear_labels" != "" ]]; then
                echo "Clearing cleared labels: $clear_labels"
                continue
            else
                echo "No more labels to process"
                break
            fi
        else
            IFS= read -r clear_labels <<< "$line"
            if [[ "$clear_labels" == "" ]]; then
                echo "Clearing cleared labels: $clear_labels"
                continue
            else
                echo "No more labels to process"
                break
            fi
        done
    }
}

# Step 2: Read multiple log files and process them
read_log_files() {
    local -i log_files=*
    for file in "$log_files"; do
        cat "$file" | grep -o "^ERROR" | sed 's/".* / /g' | cut -d\s+ -f2 | sort -|(.) | sort -| sort -| tr ' ' '\n' > temp.log
        while true; do
            if [ ! -q "temp.log$file" ]; then
                break
            else
                read_log_lines "$file"
                sleep 1 # for demonstration, adjust as needed
            fi
        done
    done
}

# Step 3: Extract and process tokens per label group
clear_labels=""

read_log_files "$*"

process_log_lines

# Step 4: Handle test cases evaluation
test_cases="{'expected': 'correct', 'actual': 'incorrect'}"

while read -a line_list=; do
    case in
        "success")
            echo "Test passed"
            ;;
        "error $line"
            echo "Test failed: $line"
            ;;
    esac
    local expected=$?
    local actual=$?
    
    if [[ "$actual" != "${test_cases[$expected]'" || "${test_cases[$actual]'}" ]]; then
        echo "Expected $expected, got $actual"
    else
        echo "All test cases passed!"
    fi
}

# Step 5: Estimate tokens using shell functions
read_log_files "$*"

# Example function to estimate tokens
estimate_tokens.sh

# Clear labels after processing all logs
clear_labels=""

# Combine and run the final script
/Ollama script here (fill in with any needed logic)
