# Bash‑Script Code Review – *Ollama Bash Lib* (v0.45.2)

> **Target environment** – Bash 3.2 *or higher* (e.g. macOS 10.14+ / Ubuntu 12.04).  
> **Goal** – Ensure the script runs correctly and safely under Bash 3.2, while keeping it maintainable and user‑friendly.

---

## 1. Quick Summary

| ✅ | ❗ | ⚠️ |
|---|---|---|
| *Compatible with Bash 3.2*, no 4.0‑specific features. | **Minor bugs** that would surface in production. | **Security reminders** (input sanitisation, exposure of secrets). |

> Overall, the library is *well‑structured* and *readable*. A few safety and portability tweaks are recommended.

---

## 2. Compatibility Checklist (Bash 3.2)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `[[ ... ]]` with `=~` regex | ✅ | Bash 3.2 supports extended regex. |
| Arrays (`declare -a`, `${var[@]}` etc.) | ✅ | Basic arrays are available. |
| Subshell / process substitution `>( )` | ✅ | Introduced in Bash 3.2. |
| Arithmetic expansion `(( ))` | ✅ | Bash 3.2 has this. |
| `printf` with `${var:0:len}` substring | ✅ | Supported in Bash 3.2. |
| `local` inside functions | ✅ | Bash 3.2 allows local variables. |
| `command -v` | ✅ | POSIX‑compliant. |
| `"$(<file)"` or `< <(...)` redirection | ✅ | Process substitution is supported. |

*No 4.0‑only syntax or built‑ins are used.*

## 3. Highlights & Strengths

| Feature | Why It’s Good |
|---------|---------------|
| **Structured help / usage strings** – every public function prints a helpful usage block when `-h/--help` is passed. |
| **Global configuration variables** – `OLLAMA_LIB_*` are self‑documenting and all come with sane defaults. |
| **Centralised HTTP wrapper (`_call_curl`)** – one place to patch credentials/headers → easier maintenance. |
| **Verbose debugging** – `_debug` respects `OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG` levels and auto‑redacts private keys. |
| **Safe eval guard** – `ollama_eval` is disabled in safe mode. |
| **Array usage for messages & tools** – the API keeps state in Bash arrays, which is efficient. |
| **Explicit exit codes** – each function returns 0/1 (or higher) and prints a diagnostic when failing. |

---

## 4. Issues & Edge‑Cases

| Issue | Symptom | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **_is_valid_json – JSON `false`/`null`**<br>returns exit code 1 → treated as error. | Model responses containing `false` or `null` would abort. | Only reject on a *real* JSON parse error. Keep `jq -e` but treat `false`/`null` as ok, or add special handling when that case occurs. |
| **_ollama_thinking_stream** – `cat >&2` can read *all* remaining stdin, potentially swallowing text that shouldn't be wrapped. | Stream‑to‑stdout/err interplay may produce double output. | Use a dedicated variable to buffer the rest of the input instead of `cat`. |
| **Tool definition quoting** – building `tools_json` via `IFS=,; echo "${ARR[*]}"` may break on tool definitions that contain commas or newlines. | Malformed JSON in `/_ollama_payload_generate`. | Use `jq -s` or `jq -c .` to combine array elements safely. |
| **Process substitution in Bash 3.2** – `2> >( _ollama_thinking_stream )` works, but if `_ollama_thinking_stream` consumes the rest of the stream it may swallow data. | Output loss and unexpected behaviour on some systems. | Replace with an explicit `while` loop that pipes stderr separately, or keep a copy of the data for debugging. |
| **`read -s` in `ollama_app_turbo`** – Some older `/bin/bash` may not honour `-s` in `read`. | Prompt for key could echo characters. | Test the combination or use `stty -echo`/`stty echo` with a `trap` to restore. |
| **Variable expansion inside array index calculation** –`(( OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM == 0 ))` inside `_ollama_payload_generate`. | In Bash 3.2, arithmetic contexts only use integers – fine. | None. |
| **Potential shell injection** – `"$command" "$tool_args_str"` in `ollama_tools_run`. | If a tool is malicious, its command is executed verbatim. | Document that tool definitions should come from trusted sources or sanitize `command` with `printf %q`. |
| **Missing `export` for `OLLAMA_HOST` in `ollama_app_turbo`** – only `OLLAMA_HOST` is exported, but `OLLAMA_LIB_API` may be required by some downstream callers. | Tools that reference `OLLAMA_LIB_API` may not pick up the new host. | Export `OLLAMA_LIB_API=` after exporting `OLLAMA_HOST`. |
| **Usage of `shuf`** – absent on minimal systems. | `ollama_model_random` would fall back to `awk` (less uniform). | Keep fallback but warn the user if `shuf` is missing. |
| **`kill` and `killall`** are in dangerous regex. | `killall` could be part of command names (e.g., `killall -9`). | Refine regex to anchor at word boundaries. |
| **`OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG` is numeric but not validated** – non‑numeric values could lead to arithmetic errors. | `(( OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG ))` may interpret “foo” as 0. | Force numeric assignment (`1`/`0`/`2`). |
| **`printf '%s\n' "$(_is_valid_model "$1")"`** – if no model, prints nothing but still returns 0. | Caller may think a valid model was found. | Return 1 if `is_valid_model` outputs empty string. |
| **Uninitialized variables** – some functions read `$OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` before it's defined. | No effect, but still defined earlier. | Declare it as empty at the top to avoid “undefined” warnings on `set -u`. |

---

## 5. Security & Secret Management

| Area | Current Behavior | Suggested Fix |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **API Key Exposure** | `ollama_app_turbo` stores the key in `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` *without* exporting it, which is good. But the key can be displayed if the user prints `$OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` or via `export`. | Add a `__hidden__` comment or a small wrapper to guard against accidental echo: `if [[ -n ${SHOW_TURBO_KEY:-} ]]; then echo "$OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY"; fi`. |
| **Redaction** | `_redact` removes the key from all debug logs. | Ensure every debug call passes the message through `_redact`. Currently some error paths print raw input (e.g., `ollama_model_unload` prints `$result`). | Wrap all error prints with `_redact`. |
| **Command Injection** | `ollama_tools_run` passes untrusted `$command` directly to the shell. | Quote the command: `"$command"` is fine, but also escape `$tool_args_str` (`printf '%q'`). Document that tool definitions must be whitelisted or validated beforehand. |
| **Read‑only Environment** | `ollama_eval` runs commands in sanitized environment; still uses `bash -r -c`. | Consider adding `set -euo pipefail` inside the sandbox. |
| **Password Prompt** | `ollama_app_turbo` uses `read -s` to hide the key. | Add `stty -echo` fallback and `trap` to restore terminal state on error or signal. |
| **Sensitive Variables** | `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` etc. get printed by `ollama_app_vars`. | Redact any environment variable containing a key or token. Use `_get_redacted_var`. It already does this. |

---

## 6. Style & Readability

| Issue | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| **Long function definitions** – many functions exceed 100 lines. | Split large helpers into sub‑functions, e.g., `__build_payload` or `__json_validate`. |
| **Duplicate help strings** – each function repeats a full usage block. | Store help strings in variables or data-structures to avoid duplication. |
| **Naming** – public functions use a `ollama_` prefix; internal helpers use leading underscore. | Consistent: `_internal_*` for private functions, `ollama_*` for public. |
| **Variable naming** – use `OLLAMA_LIB_*` consistently (already done). | Good. |
| **Error handling** – many commands use `if ! cmd; then ...; fi`. | Use `set -euo pipefail` where appropriate, or capture errors centrally. |
| **Unnecessary subshells** – `(( error_code ))` vs `$?`. | Prefer `local rc=$?` for clarity. |
| **Documentation** – the README‑style usage strings are nice but would benefit from a generated help file or auto‑documentation tool. | Consider adding a `--version` option to output everything. |

## 7. Suggested Refactor Ideas

1. **Centralized Validation**  
   ```bash
   isJSON() { ... }   # Re‑use for all JSON checks
   isValidModel() { ... }
   isAPIEndpoint() { ... }
   ```
2. **Unified HTTP Layer**  
   Use one function (`_http_request`) that accepts method, path, payload JSON, and returns JSON or error. All higher‑level API wrappers call this.
3. **Avoid Global Mutations**  
   In streaming functions (`ollama_generate_stream`, `ollama_chat_stream`) reset `OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM` by setting local variable and restoring in `trap` or after the call. This prevents side‑effects for callers that expect `OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM` unchanged.
4. **Add Unit Tests**  
   Bash scripting frameworks like `shunit2` or `bats` can be used to ensure that each wrapper produces the expected output and error handling in different scenarios.
5. **Use `declare -n` (Bash 4.3+) for pass‑by‑reference** – Not needed for 3.2 but worth noting for future migrations.  

---

## 8. Final Verdict

- **Bash 3.2 ready** – The script uses only features available from Bash 3.2 onward. Minor syntax like `${var:0:len}` and arithmetic expansion are fine.
- **Robustness** – Generally good error handling and verbose diagnostics. A few edge‑cases (e.g. `false`/`null` JSON) can be tuned.
- **Security** – Redaction is in place; still, any tool definition should be strictly sanitized (`jq`‑based validation is a good start).  
- **Maintainability** – The code is organized, but duplication of help strings and lengthy functions could be refactored for clarity.  
- **Performance** – Acceptable for typical use; no heavy loops.

With the suggested tweaks, *Ollama Bash Lib* will be safer, more maintainable, and continue to be fully compatible with legacy Bash versions. Happy scripting!
