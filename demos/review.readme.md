Okay, this is a comprehensive documentation for the "Ol llama Bash Lib" project!  It's well-organized and covers a lot of ground. Here's a breakdown of the key information, formatted for clarity and usability.

**Project Overview: Ol llama Bash Lib**

*   **Purpose:** A Bash library designed to interact with Ollama, a tool for running Large Language Models (LLMs).  It provides a set of functions to manage models, run prompts, and retrieve information.
*   **License:** MIT License (per the provided link).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Model Management:  Listing, unloading, and showing model information.
    *   Prompt Execution:  Running prompts against Ollama models.
    *   Running processes:  Listing running model processes.
    *   Utility Functions:  Token estimation, JSON sanitization, debugging, and error handling.
    *   Integration with other projects:  The documentation links to several related projects within the Attogram project.

**Core Functions & Usage (Categorized)**

The documentation is well-structured by function category. Here's a summary of the most important functions and how to use them:

**1. Ollama Functions (Core Interaction)**

*   **`o llama_app_installed`**: Checks if Ollama is installed.  Useful for basic checks.
    ```bash
    if ollama_app_installed; then
        echo "Installed"
    else
        echo "Not Installed"
    fi
    ```
*   **`o llama_app_version`**: Gets the version of Ollama.
    ```bash
    o llama_app_version
    ```
*   **`o llama_app_version_json`**: Gets the version of Ollama in JSON format.
    ```bash
    o llama_app_version_json
    ```
*   **`o llama_app_version_cli`**: Gets the version of Ollama from the command line.
    ```bash
    o llama_app_version_cli
    ```
*   **`o llama_ps`**: Lists running Ollama processes.
    ```bash
    o llama_ps
    ```
*   **`o llama_ps_json`**: Lists running Ollama processes in JSON format.
    ```bash
    o llama_ps_json
    ```
*   **`o llama_model_random`**: Gets a random model name from the Ollama list.
    ```bash
    o llama_model_random
    ```
*   **`o llama_model_unload`**: Unloads a model from memory.
    ```bash
    o llama_model_unload <model_name>
    ```

**2. Utility Functions**

*   **`estimate_tokens`**: Estimates the number of tokens in a given string.
    ```bash
    estimate_tokens "your text string"
    ```
*   **`json_sanitize`**: Sanitizes a JSON object for use with `jq`.
    ```bash
    json_sanitize '{"key": "value"}'
    ```
*   **`debug`**:  Prints a debug message to `stderr`.
    ```bash
    debug "This is a debug message"
    ```
*   **`error`**: Prints an error message to `stderr`.
    ```bash
    error "This is an error message"
    ```

**3.  Lib Functions**

*   **`o llama_lib_about`**: Provides information about the library itself, including available functions and variables.
    ```bash
    o llama_lib_about
    ```
*   **`o llama_lib_version`**:  Displays the version of the library.
    ```bash
    o llama_lib_version
    ```

**4.  Requirements**

*   **Bash:** Version 3 or higher.
*   **Tools:** `awk`, `sed`, `tr`, `grep`, `wc`, `od`, `command`
*   **Optional:**
    *   `Ollama`:  For interacting with LLMs.
    *   `curl`: For API requests.
    *   `jq`: For JSON parsing.

**Related Projects (Attogram)**

The documentation provides links to several other projects within the Attogram project, which are related to LLMs and AI.  These include:

*   **Ol llama Multi run:**  Runs prompts against multiple models.
*   **Ol llama Bash Toolshed:**  A Bash script for interacting with models.
*   **Llm Council:**  A chat room for LLMs.
*   **Small Models:**  A comparison of small open-source LLMs.
*   **AI Test Zone:**  AI testing reports.

**Additional Notes**

*   The documentation is well-written and easy to understand.
*   The categorization of functions is helpful.
*   The inclusion of requirements is important for users to know.
*   The links to related projects are valuable for users who want to explore other tools within the Attogram ecosystem.

**Overall:**

This is a solid and well-documented project. It provides a valuable tool for automating interactions with Ollama and managing LLMs in a Bash environment.  The clear organization and comprehensive information make it easy for users to understand and use.  The links to related projects are a great addition.
