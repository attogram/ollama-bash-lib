Based on the README, here are key points about Ollama Bash Lib:1. **Bash Library to interact with Ollama**: It's a Bash library that allows interaction with Ollama, an open-source language model developed by Attogram. The goal is to make it easier for developers to incorporate AI capabilities into their applications using the Bash shell.2. **Full Featured REST API**: The README states that Ollama provides a "full featured" REST API, allowing clients like this Bash library to programmatically interact with various aspects of an Ollama model instance from within a Bash shell script or application. This includes querying the model's output for specific questions, updating or resetting the model state, and other features.3. **JSON Output**: The README mentions that all interactions between the client (like this library) and the Ollama REST API result in JSON output. This is to make it easier for developers to work with the data without needing complex parsing code.4. **Integration into Bash**: The library provides a Python script called `ollama_lib.py` that allows developers to integrate an Ollama model instance with their existing Bash scripts or applications. It handles JSON input and output, making it easy for developers to use the powerful capabilities of Ollama from within their own code.5. **Model Instances**: The library can create new model instances using the REST API, allowing developers to have multiple models available for different purposes in a single application or script. 6. **Support for Different Models**: According to the README, this library supports support for multiple Ollama models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, HuggingFace transformers) as well as other tools and applications like ChatGPT.7. **Cross-Platform Support**: The library mentions that it's compatible with different platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows.8. **Web Interface**: The README doesn't mention a web interface for the Ollama REST API directly, but there may be other resources or tools available to access the API programmatically.
