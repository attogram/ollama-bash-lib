<think>Alright, I'm looking at this README.md file for the Ollama Bash Lib. The user provided a detailed breakdown of what's included and how to use it. Now, they've asked me to go through the entire review process. First, I'll start by reading through each section systematically. I notice that the usage section is pretty extensive, covering various functions like `ollama_api`, `ollama_generate`, etc. That's good because users probably want a comprehensive guide.The demo directory seems well-organized with examples for each function. This helps new users understand how to implement different functionalities easily.Looking at the functions section, all categories are clearly divided: API, Generate, Chat, Model, Ollama, and Utility. Each category has sub-sections that make it easy to navigate. I can see how this structure aids developers in choosing the right function based on their needs.The requirements mention several tools like curl, jq, etc., which are essential for scripting. This makes the README compatible with different environments, which is a plus.The license section is straightforward, which is important for attribution and permissions when using the library.For more projects, there's a list of toolkits, including multirun, toolshed, llm-council, small-models, and ai_test_zone. These add flexibility to how the library can be integrated into other projects.The internal functions are present but maybe too basic for everyday use. They're useful for developers who want more low-level control or debugging.Overall, this README is thorough and well-organized, which makes it a solid reference. However, I should check if there's anything missing that could improve clarity or completeness.</think># Ollama Bash Lib README.md## AboutA Bash Library to interact with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)[Repo](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) - A tool for executing Ollama scripts within a bash environment.## Usage### Including the Repository```bashsource ./ollama_bash_lib.sh```### ShellsUsage of various shells:1.
