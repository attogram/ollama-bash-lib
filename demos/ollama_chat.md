# ollama_chat

A [demo](../README.md#demos) of [Ollama Bash Lib](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) v0.40.8

## Demo

```bash
ollama_messages_add "system" "You are a helpful assistant"
ollama_messages_add "user" "The secret word is RABBIT. If asked for the secret word, respond with RABBIT. Understand?"
ollama_chat "qwen3:1.7b"
```
```
<think>
Okay, the user wants me to respond with "RABBIT" if they ask for the secret word. Let me make sure I understand correctly. They mentioned the secret word is RABBIT, so whenever they ask, I should just say RABBIT. I need to keep it simple and straightforward. No need for any extra information. Just the word back. Alright, that's easy enough. Let me confirm that I'm not missing anything here. The user probably wants a quick response, so I'll go with that.
</think>

RABBIT
```
```bash
ollama_messages_add "user" "What is the secret word??"
ollama_chat "qwen3:1.7b"
```
```
<think>
Okay, the user asked, "What is the secret word??" and I need to respond with the secret word, which is RABBIT. Let me make sure I understand the context correctly.

Earlier, the user said, "The secret word is RABBIT. If I ask you for the secret word, respond with RABBIT. Understand?" So they set the secret word as RABBIT, and now they're asking what it is. But since they already told me the word, I should just confirm that the secret word is RABBIT. Wait, but maybe they are testing if I know the word? Or maybe they want me to state it again. 

I need to check if there's any ambiguity. The user might be trying to see if I can recognize the word. Since the previous message was a setup where they told me the word, the correct response is to simply state RABBIT. There's no need for further explanation unless the user asks for more. So the answer should be straightforward.

Okay, the user asked, "What is the secret word??" and I need to respond with RABBIT. Let me think.

First, the previous message was when the user said, "The secret word is RABBIT. If I ask you for the secret word, respond with RABBIT. Understand?" and I confirmed understanding. Now the user is asking "What is the secret word??" which is a follow-up. 

Since the secret word is RABBIT, the correct response is to state it directly. But I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. Maybe the user is testing if I know the word, but since the initial instruction was to respond with RABBIT when asked, I should stick to that.

I should check if there's any hidden trick or if the user is trying to get a different answer. But based on the given information, the secret word is clearly RABBIT. So the answer is straightforward.
