## My hovercraft is full of eels

Ah, classic Monty Python! 🚀🦑

If your hovercraft's cargo hold is more “eel” than “sail,” you might want to call in the marine biologist‑pilot squad. They can sort the slippery crew out and get you back on course before the next “We’re not gonna discuss the evidence” moment strikes.  

Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a quick fix:  

1. **Deploy a net** (preferably one that can handle the “throbbing eels that will not pass through holes.”)  
2. **Use a fish‑friendly deterrent** – a low‑frequency sound that scares eels like “I’ve got you, you’re out.”  
3. **Rinse, rinse, rinse** – a good old freshwater bath to neutralize the slime (just make sure your hovercraft’s tech can handle water, otherwise it’s “no water in the cabin” emergency).  

And remember, if all else fails, just give them a nice bowl of something they like (if you have a supply of lettuce, that works too). 🥬  

Good luck! And if you’re ever in a truly “eerie” situation, just call me – I’ll bring the “Monty Python” reference cards for morale.

## Explain the theory of relativity in very simple terms.

**The theory of relativity** (by Albert Einstein) is really two ideas that changed how we think about space, time and gravity.

---

### 1️⃣ Special relativity – “The speed of light is the same for everyone”

| Key idea | Simple picture |
|------|----------------|
| **Time can slow or speed up** | Imagine you’re in a car that’s going super‑fast (close to the speed of light). If you look at a watch on a friend who’s standing still, their clock looks normal to them. But to you, their clock seems *slower*. So time is relative – it depends on how fast you’re moving. |
| **Lengths get squished** | That same fast car looks shorter to an outside observer – its length is “contracted” in the direction of motion. |
| **Mass and energy are linked** | Energy \(E\) and mass \(m\) are connected by the famous equation \(E = mc^2\). This means that mass can be turned into a huge amount of energy (why nuclear power works). |
| **Nothing can go faster than light** | Light always moves at about 300,000 km/s. Nothing you can send out can exceed that, which keeps the universe organized. |

*Why it matters:* This explains why GPS satellites have to adjust their clocks, why muons created high in the sky live longer than expected, and why relativistic effects are built into many modern technologies.

---

### 2️⃣ General relativity – “Gravity is the shape of space‑time”

| Key idea | Simple picture |
|------|----------------|
| **Space‑time is a fabric** | Picture space‑time as a stretchy sheet. Throw a heavy ball (like the Sun) onto it – the sheet depresses. |
| **Objects follow the curved path** | A marble (planet) rolling nearby slides along that depression, making it look like the marble is “attracted” to the ball. That’s gravity, but really it’s just the marble following the curved shape of the sheet. |
| **Time runs slower near big masses** | If you stay close to the Sun, your clock ticks a little slower than a clock far away. This isn’t a trick – it’s real. |
| **Bending light** | Light always wants to take the straightest path. When it passes close to a massive object, the curved sheet bends that path—this is why stars appear to shift when a massive object is between us and them (gravitational lensing). |

*Why it matters:* It lets us predict how planets orbit, how the universe expands, and even how black holes work. It’s also essential for precise timing systems (like GPS) because satellites climb higher out of the Sun’s gravity well.

---

### Bottom line

- **Special relativity** tells us that time, space, and mass change depending on speed.
- **General relativity** tells us that gravity is not a force pulled between masses, but the result of masses curving the “fabric” of space‑time.

Both together give us the modern picture of the universe and are key to countless technologies we rely on every day.

## Invent a new holiday and describe how people celebrate it.

## **The Day of Shared Stories (DoSS)**  
**Date:** 21 March each year (the day the spring equinox falls in most of the world)  
**Age of celebration:** 2028 – currently in its 5th year

---

### 1. Why it exists  
During the early 2020s, mental‑health researchers found that *shared narratives*—stories told and heard together—were one of the strongest predictors of social cohesion and personal resilience.  
The *Day of Shared Stories* (DoSS) was created to celebrate that universal human gift, to bring people of all ages, cultures, and technological levels together on a day when day and night are equal in length.

---

### 2. The Core Tenets  

| Tenet | Meaning | How it’s expressed on DoSS |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| **1. Listen first** | Listening deepens understanding. | Everyone sits in a circle—physically or virtually—while someone tells a story without interruption. |
| **2. Speak gently** | Words shape reality. | Speakers are encouraged to use compassionate language; the phrase “I feel…” is favored over “you’re…” |
| **3. Share a touch** | Physical connection reinforces empathy. | Hand‐on‑hand “story threads” are passed with each new teller, starting a communal tapestry of palms. |
| **4. Celebrate differences** | Diversity enriches the narrative. | Story themes draw from the teller’s heritage, profession, or life experience. |
| **5. Make a wish** | Wishes bridge imagination and hope. | After every story, listeners write a wish (paper or digital) and fold it into a community “Wish Jar.” |

---

### 3. Typical Celebrations Around the World  

| Country | Local Twist | Symbolic Food | Iconic Practice |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Japan** | *Karaoke-Story‑Sama* – singing a story‑based riddle while guests guess the moral. | *Mochi* shaped like open books. | Toast with *sake* flavored with cherry blossoms. |
| **Brazil** | *Samba‑Story Fest* – stories told while dancing in circles; each step corresponds to a narrative beat. | *Farofa* mixed with sweet, story‑told fruit. | The *Alma* (soul) dance, where couples exchange stories while holding lanterns. |
| **Kenya** | *Sankofa Stories* – telling ancestral myths to honor the past while speaking aloud future goals. | *Ugali* served with a side of *locally grown honey* (the sweetness of memory). | A ritual “passing of the drum” where every new teller walks a small course before speaking. |
| **Canada** | *Maple‑Story Trail* – people carve stories into maple bark and then share them in cafés. | *Maple sweet pie* with edible “ink” (berries). | The “Maple‑Tree” ceremony: all participants plant a sapling and say a story about what they hope it will grow into. |
| **United States** | *Story‑Book Street Fair* – open‑air “book” stalls where strangers trade tales in exchange for stories. | *Cornbread* infused with cinnamon (the spice of surprise). | “Wish‑Tapestry” – a giant collage made from the combined wishes, hung in city squares. |

---

### 4. The Digital Platform: **StoryNet**  
**StoryNet** is a cross‑platform app (mobile, web, AR/VR) that lets users:

1. **Create a “Story Capsule”** – video / audio / text story + a 2‑minute “summarization” for quick listening.  
2. **Invite** friends or invite strangers based on shared interests with a simple “tap‑to‑connect.”  
3. **Collect Wishes** – a digital jar that shows aggregated hopes; the platform can generate a national “Wish Report” which many governments use to identify citizen’s priorities.  
4. **Community Tapestry** – a live, evolving canvas built from user‑submitted short phrases, turning into a large mosaic on the national calendar.

---

### 5. Symbols & Artifacts  

| Symbol | Description | Uses |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Story Thread** | A braided fiber that changes color as it’s passed. | The hand‑on‑hand passing ritual; each new color marks a new teller. |
| **Wish Feather** | Feathers dyed in the color of the story’s theme. | Placed in community jars; collected and celebrated on the final day of the holiday. |
| **Paper Lanterns** | Enclosed story fragments printed on origami paper. | Lighting is performed in quiet moments of reflection in parks and city squares. |

---

### 6. The Etiquette Guide  

1. **Open the circle** – a gentle nod or palm handshake.  
2. **Speak the story** – keep it under 15 minutes to honor the circle’s collective attention.  
3. **Use “I” language** – make story personal to help listeners connect.  
4. **Share a wish** – write on a leaf, a piece of paper, or a digital note.  
5. **Exit gracefully** – thank the teller, offer a brief comment, pass the thread.

---

### 7. Impact & Future  

- **Mental Health**: Early statistics indicate a 27 % rise in reported well‑being in cities that celebrated DoSS.  
- **Community Building**: The “Wish Report” becomes a source for local governments to address community desires (e.g., parks, libraries, tech hubs).  
- **Education**: Schools adopt DoSS to improve listening skills and empathy in students.  
- **Cultural Exchange**: Nations that host *StoryNet* livestream festivals in real time, allowing a global audience to experience regional stories firsthand.

---

### 8. How You (and I) can Celebrate  

1. **Gather a circle**: Invite friends, family, coworkers, or neighbors for a storytelling evening.  
2. **Pick a theme**: "A time I changed," "A place I loved," or "A lesson from a mistake."  
3. **Share without judgment**: Listen actively and allow the next person to add to the narrative.  
4. **Write a wish**: Even a simple hope (“I wish for calmer mornings”) can become a spark in the community jar.  
5. **Pass the thread**: Whether literally handing a ribbon or metaphorically handing a story to the next person, keep the cycle alive.  

Celebrate the Day of Shared Stories by remembering that the simplest way to connect is by letting our voices carry each other's hearts across the distance—from the next room to the next continent. Happy DoSS! 🎉📚✨

## If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, how far does it go?

At a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, the train covers:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60\ \text{mph} \times 3\ \text{h} = 180\ \text{miles}
\]

So the train travels **180 miles**.

## Translate to French: 'The weather is nice today.'

Le temps est agréable aujourd’hui.

## Is the following review positive or negative? 'I loved the movie, it was fantastic!'

Positive

## If all cats are animals and some animals are playful, can we say some cats are playful?

**Answer: No.**  

**Why?**

1. **Premise 1:** *All cats are animals.*  
   → The set of cats is a subset of the set of animals.

2. **Premise 2:** *Some animals are playful.*  
   → There exists at least one animal that is playful. This animal could be a cat, but it could also be any other animal in the broader “animals” category.

Because the second premise does not specify which animals are playful, we cannot determine whether the “some playful animals” overlap with the set of cats. It is entirely possible that the playful animals are all non‑cat species. Therefore, from those two statements alone we cannot conclude that **any** cat is playful. The correct logical conclusion is that we only know: *there exists a playful animal*, but we have no guarantee that a cat is among them.

## Write a Bash function that returns the sum of a list of numbers.

Below is a tiny Bash helper that adds up as many numbers you give it.  
It works for ordinary integers (and a handful of simple integer‑based arithmetic), and it also has a quick‑and‑dirty float‑friendly version that uses `awk`.

```bash
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bash function: sum() – sum a list of integer arguments
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
sum() {
  local total=0          # total will grow with each value
  for n in "$@"; do     # "$@" preserves each argument exactly
    (( total += n ))     # simple Bash arithmetic (integers only)
  done
  echo "$total"          # return the sum by printing it
}

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example usage (integers)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# result=$(sum 10 20 30)  # result == 60
# echo "$result"

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Optional: a float‑aware variant (requires awk)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
sum_floats() {
  awk "BEGIN{sum=0; for(i=1;i<NARG;i++) sum+=ARGV[i]; print sum}" "$@"
}

# Example with floats:
#   res=$(sum_floats 1.5 2.25 3)
#   echo "$res"   # 6.75

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why we don't use 'return' to hand back the value
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bash 'return' can only give values 0–255 (exit status).  
# For arbitrary integers/floats, printing (or setting a global/local var) is the usual way.
```

### Quick recap

- **`sum "$@"`** – Adds all the supplied arguments and prints the total so you can capture it with command substitution: `total=$(sum 1 2 3)`.
- Use **`sum_floats`** if you need to include decimal numbers; otherwise stick with `sum`.
- The function is POSIX‑compliant for integer addition; the float version leverages `awk`, which is available on almost every Unix‑like system.

Feel free to drop this into your scripts or `.bashrc` and enjoy quick numeric summation in Bash!

## If you drop a glass on the floor, what is most likely to happen?

If you simply let a typical household glass fall onto a hard floor, the most common outcome is that it **breaks** – usually shattering into many sharp shards that scatter across the surface.  

- **If the glass is full** (e.g., a bottle or a glass of water), the liquid will spill as the container cracks or fractures.  
- **If the glass is thick, tempered, or specially manufactured**, it may withstand a small drop and stay intact, but even then a hard impact on a concrete or tile floor can still cause cracks or minor deformations.  
- **Safety note:** Broken glass can pose a serious injury hazard. After the fall, carefully sweep up any fragments, or use a damp towel or a paper towel to pick them up, and dispose of them in a puncture‑resistant container.  

So in everyday terms: **the glass most likely shatters into shards, possibly spilling its contents.**

## A rectangle has a length of 10 meters and a width of 4 meters. What is its area?

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.

\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10\,\text{m} \times 4\,\text{m} = 40\,\text{m}^2
\]

So, the rectangle’s area is **40 square meters**.

## What is the largest ocean on Earth?

The largest ocean on Earth is the **Pacific Ocean**.
