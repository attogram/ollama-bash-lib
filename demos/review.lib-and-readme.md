# Sync review of [ollama_bash_lib.sh](../ollama_bash_lib.sh) AND [README.md](../README.md)

A [demo](../README.md#demos) of [Ollama Bash Lib](https://github.com/attogram/ollama-bash-lib) v0.45.5

# Review of `README.md` vs. `ollama_bash_lib.sh`

Below is a quick audit comparing the public‑facing documentation against the current source.  
The table and the prose in the README largely match the implemented library, but a few functions that exist in the codebase are omitted from the “Functions” table, which can mislead users trying to find them by reference.  No other major inconsistencies were found.

| Section | Issue | Description | Suggested Fix |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Functions table** | _Missing entries_ | The following library functions are *not* listed in the “Functions” table even though they are present, exported, and documented elsewhere in the README (e.g. “Howto” section). | Add rows for:  <br>**`ollama_app_vars`** (`oav`) – shows Ollama‑related environment variables.  <br>**`ollama_app_version_cli`** (`oavc`) – returns the Ollama CLI version string.  <br>Review if any others (like `ollama_lib_about`/`olv`, etc.) are omitted. |
| **Alias column** | Minor mismatch for `ollama_list_json` | The alias shown in the table is `olj`.  In the source it’s actually exported as `olj`.  No issue, just a visual check that the alias matches the function name. | None. |
| **Documentation snippets** | The `ollama_turbo` alias is shown as `ollama_app_turbo`.  | The README uses `ollama_app_turbo` in the demos; it’s consistent with the alias `oat`.  No problem. | None. |
| **Quickstart demo output** | The demo shows a command that starts with `ollama_generate ...` but the demo code actually calls `ollama_generate` (`og`).  | The abbreviation alias `og` is not shown in the Quickstart output, but it works. | Optional: add a note that `ollama_generate` can be invoked via the alias `og`. |
| **Consistent helper wording** | The “Helper Functions” table lists `ollama_eval` (`oe`) but the README “Howto” section already references `ollama_eval`.  | They are in sync. | None. |
| **No alias for `ollama_app_version_cli` in “Functions” table** |  | Already covered under “Missing entries.” | |

## Summary

- **All public functions are implemented** and their aliases match the documentation, **except for a small omission** in the functions table.
- The **table of functions** should be expanded to include:

```markdown
| Function<br />Alias | About | Usage | Output | Return |
|---------------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| `ollama_app_vars`<br />`oav` | Display Ollama environment variables | `ollama_app_vars` | ... | 0 |
| `ollama_app_version_cli`<br />`oavc` | Ollama version, CLI version | `ollama_app_version_cli` | ... | 0 |
```

  (Add the *About*, *Usage*, *Output*, and *Return* columns as per the style used for the other rows.)

- Once these rows are added, the README will perfectly reflect the library’s interface.

**Recommendation:**  
Update the “Functions” section to include all existing functions. No code changes are necessary.
