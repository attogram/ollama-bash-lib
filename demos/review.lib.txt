Do a full code review of this script:
file: /ollama-bash-lib/ollama_bash_lib.sh

 This script, `ollama_bash_lib.sh`, is a Bash library for interacting with the Ollama API. It provides various functions for managing models, making requests, and estimating the number of tokens in a string. Here's a code review of the script:

1. **Variable declarations** are well-organized and self-explanatory. They include version information, default URL for the Ollama API, success and error return codes, and other constants used throughout the script.

2. The `ollama_about_lib` function displays information about the library, such as name, version, URL, license, copyright, debug status, and functions available in the library.

3. The `debug` function provides a mechanism for logging debug messages when the debug flag is set to 1. This can be useful for testing or troubleshooting purposes.

4. The `ollama_installed` function checks if Ollama is installed on the local system by checking the presence of the 'ollama' command. If it exists, the function returns 0 (success); otherwise, it returns 1 (error).

5. The `json_safe` function escapes a string for use as a JSON value, ensuring that special characters are properly encoded.

6. The `ollama_get`, `ollama_post`, `ollama_unload_model`, `ollama_generate`, and related functions make requests to the Ollama API using `curl`. These functions could be improved by handling errors more gracefully, such as providing error messages or exit codes.

7. The `ollama_list`, `ollama_list_json`, `ollama_list_array`, `ollama_random_model`, `ollama_ps`, and `ollama_ps_json` functions provide ways to interact with the Ollama API to list models, show model information, and check running processes.

8. The `ollama_version`, `ollama_version_json`, and `ollama_version_cli` functions retrieve the version of the Ollama application.

9. The `estimate_tokens` function calculates an estimate for the number of tokens in a string, based on the number of words, characters, or bytes. The function also provides a verbose mode that displays the estimated error range.

Overall, the script is well-written and easy to understand. However, it could benefit from additional comments describing each function's purpose and usage, as well as error handling throughout the script. Additionally, it might be helpful to provide more examples for using the library in various scenarios.
