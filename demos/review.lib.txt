<think>
Okay, I'm going to do a full code review of this Bash script called ollama-bash-lib.sh. Let me start by reading through the code carefully and looking for potential issues, improvements, and best practices.

First, I'll check the shebang line. It's #!/usr/bin/env bash, which is correct for Bash scripts. The script seems to be a library for interacting with Ollama, so it's probably meant to be sourced or used as a function.

Looking at the variables at the top, OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_VERSION is set to 0.27.0, but the copyright year is 2025. That might be a typo or a mistake. The version should probably match the current year if it's a recent release. Also, the URL is set to the GitHub repo, which is good.

Next, the functions. The ollama_about_lib function outputs a bunch of info. It uses compgen -A function to list all functions, which is okay, but maybe it's better to have a more controlled list. Also, the function returns $? which is the exit code of compgen, but the function is supposed to return 0 on success. Wait, the function is supposed to return 0 on success, but compgen might return 0 even if there are no functions. Hmm, maybe that's okay, but the doc says it returns 0 on success, 1 on error. But compgen is used here, which might not be the best approach. Maybe the function should check if any functions exist, but that's probably okay for now.

The debug function checks if OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_DEBUG is 1 and then echoes to stderr. That's standard. The ollama_installed function uses command -v to check if ollama is installed. That's correct, but maybe it's better to handle the case where command -v returns an error, but the script seems to handle that with 2> /dev/null.

The json_safe function uses jq to escape a string. The usage is to pass a string, and then use jq -Rn to read it as a raw string. That should work. But the function returns $? which is the exit code of jq. However, the comment says TODO - if jq error, get error info. So maybe the function should handle errors more gracefully, but the current code is okay for now.

The ollama_get and ollama_post functions use curl. They have the same structure. The ollama_get uses -X GET and the ollama_post uses -X POST. The curl commands include the Content-Type header. That's good. However, the functions return $? which is the exit code of curl. The comment says TODO - if curl error, get error info. So maybe the functions should check for errors and handle them, but again, the current code is acceptable.

Looking at ollama_unload_model, it sends a POST to /api/generate with a JSON payload. The function uses the response and returns the return code. However, the response is not checked for success. For example, if the API returns an error, the function might not handle it. Also, the debug output is just the response, which might not be very helpful. Maybe the function should parse the response to check if the model was unloaded successfully.

The ollama_generate function sends a POST to /api/generate with the model and prompt. It then uses jq to extract the .response field. The function returns the return code of the curl command. However, if the API response has an error, the function might not catch it. Also, the echo command could fail if the result is not valid JSON. The comment says TODO - if Post error, show error and return 1. So maybe the function should handle that.

The ollama_generate_json function is similar but returns the entire JSON response. That's okay.

The ollama_generate_stream function is for streaming. It uses a while loop to read lines from the curl output and processes each line with jq to extract the response. However, the code uses a subshell with <(ollama_post ...), which might not be the best approach. Also, the echo -ne \"$response\" might not handle all cases. The return code is set, but the function might not handle errors from the curl or the processing.

The ollama_list and ollama_list_json functions call the ollama command directly. The ollama_list_json function uses ollama_get to /api/tags, which is correct. However, the ollama_list function might not be compatible with all versions of ollama. For example, if the ollama CLI is not available, the function might fail. The ollama_list_array function uses ollama list and then processes the output. The sorting is done with sort, which is okay. But the function might fail if the ollama list command is not available.

The ollama_random_model function uses the array of models and picks a random one. However, if the array is empty, it might return an error. Also, the use of RANDOM%${#models[@]} could be problematic if the array is empty, but the function has a check for that. Wait, no: models=($(ollama_list_array)) would return an error if ollama_list_array fails, but the function is supposed to return 1 on error. However, the function doesn't check if models is empty. For example, if there are no models, models would be an empty array, and trying to access models[RANDOM%0] would be invalid. So this could be a bug. The function should check if the array is empty and return an error.

The ollama_ps function calls ollama ps, which is okay. The ollama_ps_json function uses ollama_get to /api/ps, which is correct.

The ollama_show function calls ollama show, which is okay. The ollama_show_json function sends a POST to /api/show with the model name. That's correct.

The ollama_version functions use ollama_get to /api/version and then parse the JSON. The ollama_version_cli calls ollama --version, which is correct.

The estimate_tokens function seems to be a bit complex. It handles input from a file, stdin, or a string. The function calculates tokens based on words, characters, and bytes. However, the calculation might not be accurate. For example, the formula for tokensWords is (words * 100) / 75, which assumes 0.75 words per token. Similarly for characters and bytes. But the actual tokenization depends on the model. Also, the verbose output includes a range, but the calculation for min and max might not be correct. The function might need to handle cases where the input is empty or invalid. Also, the use of -t 0 to check if input is from a terminal is not reliable. The function might not handle piped input correctly if the input is not from a terminal. The function also uses printf \"%s\" \"$string\" | wc -m for characters, which might not count bytes correctly. The wc -m counts characters, but in some cases, it might not be accurate. Also, the function might not handle multi-byte characters correctly.

Now, looking for code structure and style. The script uses a lot of comments, which is good. However, some comments are just TODOs, which should be addressed. The variables are declared at the top, which is good. The functions have docstrings explaining their usage, which is helpful.

Potential issues:

1. The OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_VERSION is 0.27.0 but the copyright is 2025. That's a discrepancy. The version should probably match the release date or the current year if it's a recent version. Maybe the version is 0.27.0 and the copyright is 2025, but that's a bit odd. It's possible that the version was updated recently, but the copyright year is 2025. That might be a mistake.

2. The ollama_unload_model function uses the response from the POST to /api/generate, but the actual API might not return a success status. The function should check the response for success. For example, the API might return a status code indicating success or failure. The function should parse the JSON response to check if the model was unloaded.

3. The ollama_generate function uses the response from the POST and then pipes it to jq to extract .response. However, if the API returns an error, the function might not handle it. The function should check for errors in the response.

4. The ollama_generate_stream function uses a while loop to read lines from the curl output. However, the way it's structured might not handle all cases, especially if the response is not line-based. Also, the echo -ne \"$response\" might not handle all cases correctly.

5. The ollama_list_array function uses ollama list and then processes the output. However, if the ollama list command is not available or fails, the function might not handle the error properly. The function should check for errors and return 1 if needed.

6. The ollama_random_model function could have an error if the models array is empty. The function should check if the array is empty and return an error.

7. The estimate_tokens function has a complex calculation. The formulas for tokensWords, tokensChars, and tokensBytes might not be accurate. The function also has a section where it calculates min and max, but the logic could be improved. Also, the handling of input (file, stdin, or string) might not be robust.

Other considerations:

- The script uses functions that call external commands like ollama, curl, jq, etc. These dependencies should be checked, but the script assumes they are available.

- The script uses a lot of global variables, which is acceptable in Bash, but could be encapsulated better if needed.

- The script uses eval or similar constructs? Not that I can see, but the json_safe function uses jq, which is safe.

- The script uses echo to output results, which is okay, but for JSON outputs, it's better to ensure that the output is properly formatted.

- The script uses return $? in many functions, which is correct for returning the exit code of the last command.

- The script uses redirections like 2> /dev/null to suppress errors, which is okay, but could be handled more gracefully.

- The script uses variables like OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API which is set to the default, but the user can override it. That's good.

- The script's functions are named consistently, but some functions have similar names (like ollama_generate and ollama_generate_json), which is okay.

- The script's functions are well-documented with usage and return codes, which is good for maintainability.

Potential improvements:

1. Fix the version and copyright year discrepancy if it's a mistake.

2. Add error handling for API responses in functions like ollama_unload_model and ollama_generate to check for success.

3. Improve the estimate_tokens function's token calculation to be more accurate, perhaps by using a more reliable method or referencing the model's tokenizer.

4. Handle cases where the models array is empty in ollama_random_model.

5. Ensure that all functions handle errors properly, especially when calling external commands.

6. Add more robust error handling for the estimate_tokens function, especially when reading input from files or stdin.

7. Consider using a more reliable way to determine if input is from a terminal or piped, as -t 0 might not be reliable.

8. Improve the ollama_list_array function to handle errors from ollama list.

9. Ensure that all functions that return JSON or other structured data handle parsing and errors appropriately.

10. Add more comments or documentation for less obvious parts of the code, such as the token estimation logic.

Overall, the script is well-structured and provides useful functions for interacting with Ollama. However, there are areas where error handling could be improved, and some functions could be made more robust.

# Code Review of `ollama-bash-lib.sh`

---

## ✅ **Overview**

This script is a Bash library for interacting with the **Ollama** API and CLI. It provides a set of functions to manage models, generate text, and query Ollama's status. The code is well-structured, with clear documentation and consistent naming. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of **error handling**, **robustness**, and **code quality**.

---

## 🛠 **Code Quality & Style**

### ✅ **Good Practices**
- **Clear documentation**: Each function has a docstring explaining usage, output, and return codes.
- **Consistent naming**: Functions follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `ollama_generate`, `ollama_list_json`).
- **Global variables**: Useful for configuration (`OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_API`, etc.), though could be encapsulated further.
- **Debugging**: The `debug` function provides useful feedback during development.

### ⚠️ **Improvements Needed**
- **Error handling**: Many functions assume external commands (e.g., `ollama`, `jq`, `curl`) succeed, but lack robust error checking.
- **Input validation**: Functions like `estimate_tokens` and `ollama_random_model` could fail silently in edge cases.
- **Redundant logic**: Some functions (e.g., `ollama_list`, `ollama_ps`) call external CLI tools directly instead of using the API.
- **Token estimation**: The `estimate_tokens` function uses simplistic heuristics that may not reflect actual model behavior.
- **Code duplication**: Similar logic exists in multiple functions (e.g., `ollama_generate`, `ollama_generate_stream`, `ollama_generate_json`).

---

## 🧠 **Critical Issues & Recommendations**

### 1. **Version/Copyright Mismatch**
```bash
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_VERSION=\"0.27.0\"
OLLAMA_BASH_LIB_COPYRIGHT=\"Copyright (c) 2025 Attogram Project\"
```
- **Issue**: The version `0.27.0` likely predates 2025. This is a **typo** or **inconsistency**.
- **Fix**: Update the copyright year to match the current year if the version is recent.

---

### 2. **Missing API Error Handling**
#### Example: `ollama_unload_model`
```bash
response=$(ollama_post \"/api/generate\" \"{\\"model\\": \\"$1\\", \\"keep_alive\\": 0}\")
return=$?
```
- **Issue**: The script assumes the API call succeeds. It does **not** validate the response.
- **Fix**: Parse the response to check for success (e.g., `jq .error` or `jq .status`).

#### Example: `ollama_generate`
```bash
echo \"$result\" | jq -r \".response\"
```
- **Issue**: If the API returns an error (e.g., invalid model), this will fail silently.
- **Fix**: Check for errors in the response and handle them explicitly.

---

### 3. **Redundant CLI Calls**
#### Example: `ollama_list` and `ollama_list_json`
```bash
ollama list
ollama_get \"/api/tags\"
```
- **Issue**: These functions call both the CLI and the API, leading to **redundancy** and potential **inconsistencies**.
- **Fix**: Use the API consistently (e.g., `ollama_list_json` should use `/api/tags` instead of `ollama list`).

---

### 4. **Token Estimation Logic**
#### Example: `estimate_tokens`
```bash
tokensWords=$(( (words * 100) / 75 )) # 1 token = 0.75 words
```
- **Issue**: This assumes a fixed tokenization rate, which may not match the model's actual tokenizer.
- **Fix**: Use a more accurate method (e.g., query the model's tokenizer API or use a dedicated tokenizer tool).

---

### 5. **`ollama_random_model` Edge Case**
```bash
echo \"${models[RANDOM%${#models[@]}]}\"
```
- **Issue**: If `models` is empty, this will fail with an index out-of-range error.
- **Fix**: Check if the array is empty and return an error.

---

### 6. **Input Handling in `estimate_tokens`**
```bash
if [ -t 0 ]; then # Not piped input
```
- **Issue**: `-t 0` checks if stdin is a terminal, which is **not reliable** for detecting piped input.
- **Fix**: Use `PIPESTATUS` or a more robust method to detect input source.

---

## 🛠 **Suggested Enhancements**

### 1. **Error Handling for API Responses**
Add checks for API errors:
```bash
response=$(ollama_post \"/api/generate\" \"$payload\")
if [[ $? -ne 0 || \"$response\" == \"null\" ]]; then
  echo \"API error: $response\"
  return 1
fi
```

### 2. **Consistent API Usage**
Replace CLI calls with API calls for consistency:
```bash
ollama_list_json() {
  ollama_get \"/api/tags\"
}
```

### 3. **Token Estimation Improvements**
Use a more accurate method (e.g., query the model's tokenizer):
```bash
estimate_tokens() {
  local model=$1
  local payload=\"{\\"model\\": \\"$model\\", \\"input\\": \\"$string\\"}\"
  local response=$(ollama_post \"/api/tokenize\" \"$payload\")
  # Parse response for token count
}
```

### 4. **Input Validation**
Add input validation for functions like `ollama_generate`:
```bash
if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then
  echo \"Usage: ollama_generate <model> <prompt>\"
  return 1
fi
```

---

## 📌 **Summary**

| **Aspect**         | **Status** | **Recommendation** |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Error Handling**  | ❌ Poor    | Add explicit error checks for API responses |
| **Code Duplication**| ⚠️ Medium  | Refactor repeated logic (e.g., `ollama_generate` variants) |
| **Token Estimation**| ⚠️ Low     | Replace with model-specific tokenizer |
| **Input Handling**  | ⚠️ Medium  | Improve input detection and validation |
| **Version/Copyright**| ⚠️ Low     | Fix version/year inconsistency |

---

## ✅ **Final Verdict**

The `ollama-bash-lib.sh` script is a **useful tool** for interacting with Ollama, but it requires **improvements in error handling, consistency, and robustness**. With the suggested enhancements, it can become a **reliable and maintainable Bash library** for Ollama integration.
