2. **Chat Management**: Leverage `ollama_chat`, `ollama_messages_add`, and other chat-related functions to engage in conversations with AI models. Send messages and receive responses seamlessly, enhancing collaboration and automation potential.

3. **Model Administration**: Manage Ollama model listings, details, and status updates using `ollama_list`, `ollama_show`, `ollama_lib_about`, and `ollama_lib_version`. These functions offer a convenient way to keep track of your models' health and performance.

4. **Extensive Function Library**: Boasting an extensive range of functions, Ollama Bash Lib includes tools for prompt generation, chat functionalities, model management, information retrieval, and more – all designed for ease of use within the bash environment.
