## Demo

```bash
ollama_generate_json "gpt-oss:20b" "Describe a rabbit in 3 words"
```
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-oss:20b",
  "created_at": "2025-08-16T22:17:58.742303358Z",
  "response": "Soft, quick, curious",
  "thinking": "We need to produce a description of a rabbit in 3 words. The user: \"Describe a rabbit in 3 words\". So we should output three descriptive words. Likely something like \"fluffy, quick, graceful\". Or \"soft, nimble, curious\". Ensure exactly three words. The user doesn't ask for a sentence, just description. So output just 3 words. Probably separate by commas? But maybe just space separated? It's okay: \"Soft, quick, curious\". Thatâ€™s 3 words separated by commas. I'll do \"Soft, quick, curious\". Ensure it's exactly three words. I'll give that.",
