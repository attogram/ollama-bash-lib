"A rabbit is a cute creature with fluffy coats and long ears. They have thick fur on their back legs and tails that allow them to climb high trees easily. Rabbits are also good at digging burrows for protection from the harsh winter weather, or they can even curl up in small nests under rocks or tree branches."
