# Security Review – Ollama Bash Library (v0.45.8)

> *This audit focuses on the safety of the shell code itself – not the external APIs you talk to.  
> All findings assume the script will be executed in an untrusted user or CI environment, and that the user might try to subvert it by feeding it arbitrary input.*

Below is a line‑by‑line (conceptual) audit followed by a consolidated risk list and actionable recommendations.  
The review also verifies that the script will run on **GNU Bash v3.2+** (the minimum supported version on many legacy macOS / GNU/Linux systems).

---

## 1.  Execution & Environment

| Item | Observation | Safety Impact | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| She‑bang | `#!/usr/bin/env bash` | ✅ ensures Bash, not sh. | Good. |
| Global variables | E.g., `OLLAMA_LIB_NAME`, `OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG` | Unset or exported variables can influence behaviour. | Use `readonly` for constants. Export only variables that must be visible (`OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_TURBO_KEY`). |
|  `set -o pipefail` | Enables early exit on pipeline failure. | ✅ improves error detection. | Add `set -euo` to catch undefined variables and exit on errors. |

---

## 2.  Input Validation

| Function | Validated Inputs | Missing / Weak Validation |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|
| `_is_valid_url` | Basic regex (https/ftp/file). | Does **not** reject relative URLs or paths with `..`.  A user could pass `http://example.com/../../etc/passwd`, which is ultimately used only by `ollama_app_turbo`, so this is a low‑risk internal input. |
| `ollama_api_get` / `ollama_api_post` | Checks endpoint starts with `/`, disallows spaces or backslashes. | ✅ Prevents command‑injection or path traversal in the HTTP request. |
| `ollama_generate_json` | Checks `model` and `prompt` are provided. | ✅ |
| `ollama_tools_add` | Validates tool name uniqueness, JSON definition. | ✅ |
| `ollama_tools_run` | Checks tool name exists. | ✅ |
| `ollama_list_json` | No user input; uses internal API. | ✅ |

**Summary** – All public inputs are sanitized before reaching `curl` or `jq`.  
The only potential weak spot is in `_is_valid_url`, but the variable `OLLAMA_HOST` is normally supplied by the user or environment.  Mitigate by tightening the pattern or providing a whitelist of allowed hostnames.

---

## 3.  Command Injection

| Source | Sanitization | Caveats |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `curl` URL | `OLLAMA_LIB_API` is concatenated with `endpoint`.  `endpoint` is validated. | `OLLAMA_LIB_API` comes from environment (`OLLAMA_HOST`) – user may supply an arbitrary URL; this is expected. |
| `jq` filters | All user data is passed via `--arg` / `--argjson`. | ✅ protects against shell‑level injection. |
| `ollama_tools_run` | `"$command" "$tool_args_str"` – the command is a user‑controlled string. | By design, this allows arbitrary command execution.  The library itself cannot mitigate it; document the risk in the README. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` | Adds `Authorization: Bearer ${OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY}` as a header. | ✅ header is quoted; key is a token, unlikely to contain quotes. |
| `$(_redact ...)` | Replaces any occurrence of the token.  Uses Bash substring substitution (`${msg//pattern/replacement}`). | If the key contains shell pattern metacharacters (`*`, `?`, `[`) they will be treated as glob patterns.  This can cause *unexpected* matches, but will never inject into shell commands because it only redacts output. |
| `printf` usage | All `printf` calls use `%s` (or `%b`) and double‑quoted arguments. | ✅ prevents word splitting in the output. |

**Conclusion** – No inadvertent command injection vulnerabilities were found besides the intentional user‑controlled tool execution.

---

## 4.  Data Exposure / Logging

| Feature | Handling | Risk |
|---------|----------|------|
| Debug & Error output | Uses `_debug` / `_error`.  `_debug` redacts `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY`. | ✅ No sensitive data leaks on normal operation. |
| Printing `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` | Never printed; only stored in environment if exported. | ✅ |
| `ollama_tools_run` output | Whatever the tool prints goes to stdout; user can intercept. | By design – cannot hide it. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` prompts for API key using `read -r -s`. | Key is hidden on input; not echoed. | ✅ |
| `ollama_app_vars` | Prints many environment variables, potentially with sensitive values (`OLLAMA_AUTH`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, …). | Consider marking secrets with `[REDACTED]` using `_get_redacted_var`.  Currently only applies to variables containing `KEY`, `TOKEN`, `AUTH`. |

**Recommendation** – Apply `_get_redacted_var` to **all** environment variables printed by `ollama_app_vars` to avoid accidental disclosure of tokens or passwords.

---

## 5.  Robustness & Error Handling

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `ollama_app_turbo` uses `shift $((OPTIND-1))` unconditionally.  If `OPTIND` is `1` (no options) this becomes `shift 0` which is valid, but if `OPTIND` is unset it could result in a **negative shift** error. | Low | Guard with `: ${OPTIND-1}` or `shift $((OPTIND-1))` only if `OPTIND > 1`. |
| Some functions (`ollama_list`, `ollama_ps`) use `printf "%s\n" "$usage"` with no `>&2`.  Users might see usage text on stdout instead of stderr. | Minor UX | Redirect usage/help text to stderr (`>&2`). |
| `ollama_list_array` uses `read -r` inside a loop, but if `ollama list` outputs binary data, it could corrupt the loop. | Low | Use `read -r -d ''` or `mapfile -t`. |
| `ollama_tools_add` joins JSON definitions using `IFS=,` which can break if a definition contains commas. |  Medium | Use a robust JSON array concatenation approach: `printf -v join ','); ...` or let `jq` build the array. |
| `_is_valid_json` parses entire JSON string regardless of size.  For very large responses this could consume memory. |  Medium | Acceptable because Ollama APIs return modest payloads; keep it as is. |
| `ollama_app_vars` prints all env vars without checking `compgen`/`column` existence; missing utilities could still work because the function has fallbacks. |  Low | Good. |
| Many functions export global state (`OLLAMA_LIB_STREAM`, `OLLAMA_LIB_THINKING`).  If two scripts source this library concurrently, they may interfere. |  Medium | Not a security issue but a design risk; document that the library is not re‑entrant. |

---

## 6.  Bash‑3.2 Compatibility

> **Bash 3.2** (macOS 10.13 and older) supports:

| Feature | Used in the source | Note |
|---------|--------------------|------|
| Arrays (`arr=()`, `${arr[@]}`) | Yes | ✔ |
| `local` keyword | Yes | ✔ |
| `getopts` | Yes | ✔ |
| Process substitution `< <(...)` | Yes | ✔ |
| Arithmetic `(( ... ))` | Yes | ✔ |
| `${var//pattern/replacement}` string replacement | Yes | ✔ |
| `printf` | Yes | ✔ |

All constructs in the script are available in Bash 3.2+.  The only syntactic modernity is the `[[ … ]]` test and `${var:-}` default expansions, both present.

**Caveat** – some users may still be on macOS Mojave or older OS X where the bundled Bash is 3.2; in that case the script should explicitly check the version:

```bash
if [ "$(BASH_VERSINFO[0])" -lt 3 ]; then
  echo "This library requires Bash 3.2 or newer" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Add this near the top.

## 7.  Summary of Findings

| Category | Rating | Comments |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Input validation | ✅ | All public inputs are vetted before being interpolated into commands. |
| Command injection | ✅ | Handled via `--arg`, validated endpoints, quoted headers. |
| Secret leakage | ⚠️ | API key and certain env vars printed by `ollama_app_vars` risk exposure. |
| Compatibility | ✅ | Works on Bash v3.2+. |
| Error handling | ⚠️ | Some functions use `shift $((OPTIND-1))` when no option; may be harmless but warrants guard. |
| Output formatting | ⚠️ | Usage/help prints to stdout; consider `>&2`. |
| Array concatenation | ⚠️ | Joining tool JSON with commas can break if definitions contain commas. |
| Re‑entrancy | ⚠️ | Global mutable state may clash if multiple scripts source the lib concurrently. |

Overall, **no critical vulnerabilities** such as arbitrary code execution or data exfiltration were discovered.  The biggest security concern is unintended disclosure of sensitive environment variables.

---

## 8.  Recommendations

### 8.1  Strengthen Secret Handling

1. **Redact all sensitive env vars** printed by `ollama_app_vars`:
   ```bash
   _get_redacted_var() {
       local var_name=$1
       local var_value="${!var_name}"
       case "$var_name" in
           *AUTH*|*TOKEN*|*KEY*|*PASS*|*SECRET*|*PASSWD*)
               [[ -n $var_value ]] && var_value="[REDACTED]"
               ;;
       esac
       printf '%s' "$var_value"
   }
   ```
   Then replace the `printf` lines with `$(_get_redacted_var "$var")`.

2. Add a **flag** to `ollama_lib_about` that, when set, suppresses the display of all secrets.

### 8.2  Tighten URL Validation

Replace `_is_valid_url` regex with a stricter pattern that also checks host‑name only, no `../` traversal, and optional `:port`:

```bash
_is_valid_url() {
    local url_regex='^(https?)://[A-Za-z0-9.-]+(:[0-9]+)?$'
    [[ $1 =~ $url_regex ]]
}
```

Additionally, strip any `.../../..` sequences in `OLLAMA_HOST` before assignment.

### 8.3  Robust Array Construction

For `OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_DEFINITION` and `OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES`, build JSON arrays using `jq` rather than manual comma joins:

```bash
json_payload="$(jq -n \
    --argjson tools "$(printf '%s\n' "${OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_DEFINITION[@]}" | jq -s .)" \
    '{tools: $tools}')"
```

Similarly for messages:

```bash
printf '%s' "$(printf '%s\n' "${OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES[@]}" | jq -s .)"
```

This removes the risk of malformed JSON when elements contain commas.

### 8.4  Defensive Programming

1. **Export library constants** as `readonly`:
   ```bash
   readonly OLLAMA_LIB_NAME='Ollama Bash Lib'
   # … etc.
   ```

2. **Guard `shift` usage**:
   ```bash
   if (( OPTIND > 1 )); then shift $((OPTIND-1)); fi
   ```

3. **Redirect help/usage to stderr** to keep stdout for script output:
   ```bash
   printf '%s\n\n%s\n' "$usage" "$description" >&2
   ```

4. **Add `set -e`** after `set -o pipefail` to exit on any failed command, improving reliability.

### 8.5  Re‑entrancy and Namespacing

If the library will be sourced multiple times within the same shell, reset the global arrays before exporting new values or provide a `ollama_lib_init` function that clears state:

```bash
ollama_lib_init() {
    OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES=()
    OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_NAME=()
    OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_COMMAND=()
    OLLAMA_LIB_TOOLS_DEFINITION=()
}
```

Call this at the end of the file or expose it for user scripts.

## 9.  Final Remarks

* The library demonstrates **excellent defensive coding** around user input, command invocation, and error handling.  
* The only exposed risk is the potential accidental leak of environment variables or the deliberate execution of arbitrary tools.  
* After applying the above recommendations, the script will be more robust, easier to audit, and compliant with best practices for legacy Bash environments.  

Happy scripting!
