# Security Review – Ollama Bash Library  
*(The review covers the current upstream implementation.  All findings are based on typical security best‑practice for shell scripts, the behavior of the tools used (`curl`, `jq`, `od`, `printf`, `jq`, `awk` …) and the API it talks to.)*

---

## 1.  Scope & Threat Model
* The script is intended to run locally on a user’s machine, and it invokes the Ollama HTTP API and the local `ollama` CLI.
* The primary user‑controlled inputs are:
  * **Command‑line arguments** (`ollama_*` functions that accept `model`, `prompt`, etc.).
  * **Environment variables** (`OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_AUTH`, `OLLAMA_TURBO_KEY`, `OLLAMA_DEBUG`, …).
* The threat surface is limited to **information leakage**, **arbitrary command execution** (via injection), and **resource exhaustion**.  
* There is *no* user authentication, nor does the script write to privileged files.

---

## 2.  Overall Architecture
```
[ User ]─► ollama_* functions ─►
          ├─ build JSON (jq) ─► safe ⇒ _escape_control_characters
          └─ curl POST/GET  (Authorization optional)
```

*All user data is wrapped in JSON via `jq` before being sent to `curl`, effectively sanitizing the payloads.  The only “raw” input that makes it into a shell command is the URL which is derived from the `OLLAMA_HOST`/`OLLAMA_API` variables.  
There is no `eval` or `xargs` usage that could execute arbitrary code.*

## 3.  Detailed Findings

| Feature | Finding | Impact | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Input Sanitization** | All arguments to `jq` are passed via `--arg`/`--argjson`. | Safe – no injection into shell or JSON. | ✅ No action required. |
| **Environment Variable Usage** | `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_TURBO_KEY`, `OLLAMA_DEBUG`, etc. can be set arbitrarily. | If an attacker can set `OLLAMA_HOST`, they could force the library to talk to an arbitrary API (SSRF). If `OLLAMA_DEBUG=1`, the script will log internal JSON fragments which may contain sensitive data. | • Add validation or defaults for `OLLAMA_HOST`. <br>• Warn if `OLLAMA_DEBUG` is enabled. |
| **Command Substitution** | Uses `$(ollama list)` etc. without quoting. | No injection risk because the output is read into arrays or printed only. | ❗ None. |
| **Curl Invocation** | `curl -s -N` with `-d "@-"`. <br> No `--fail` or exit‑code handling for HTTP status codes. | The script may silently succeed when the server returns a non‑2xx status, potentially hiding errors. | Add `--fail` or parse `-w "%{http_code}"`. |
| **_escape_control_characters** | Built using `od` and `printf` – heavy but accurate. | Handles only UTF‑8 byte‑based control escapes. Does not escape malformed UTF‑8 sequences. | Consider validating UTF‑8 before processing. |
| **Debug Logging** | `_debug` prints timestamps and raw data fragments when `OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG` is set. | If the user is unaware, running in a shared environment could leak passwords or API keys. | • Document that debug may leak secrets. <br>• Add a `--no-credentials` flag for debug prints. |
| **Turbo Mode Key Disclosure** | `ollama_lib_about` prints the length of `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` but **never** the key itself. | Good practice. | ✅|
| **Environment Variable Exposure** | `ollama_app_vars` prints every `OLLAMA_*` value, including possibly sensitive ones like `OLLAMA_AUTH`. | If a user calls `ollama_app_vars` in an environment where secrets are set, those secrets are printed to stdout. | • Provide a “--no-secrets” mode. <br>• At minimum, warn the user that secrets may be exposed. |
| **Unquoted Array Expansion** | `printf '%s\n' "${OLLAMA_LIB_MESSAGES[@]}"` and `printf "%s" "$result"` – unquoted `$result` when feeding to `jq`. | If the JSON contains `$` or backticks, this could cause command substitutions in Bash *if* the code is used in a context that evaluates the string. However, here it is passed directly to a pipe; it is not evaluated. | ✅ No issue. |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Large prompts or model names can produce huge JSON payloads. <br> No size limits are enforced. | May lead to memory blow‑ups or DoS. | Add a configurable maximum prompt length. |
| **Missing `set -euo pipefail`** | The script never uses shell options to abort on unset variables or failed pipelines. | Silent failures may occur. | Add `set -euo pipefail` at the top of the script. |
| **Potential Null Byte in Streaming** | `jq -j '.response' | while IFS= read -r -d '' chunk; do` assumes null‑delimited chunks. <br> If `jq` emits non‑null‑delimited output, the loop may block. | Can cause deadlock or incorrect output in rare API responses. | Use `while IFS= read -r; do` and handle newlines explicitly. |
| **Authorization Header Injection** | Constructs header as `"Authorization: Bearer ${OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY}"`. <br> If key contains `"`, the header will break. | Very unlikely with a token; but theoretically possible. | Escape or quote key using `printf '%q'`. |
| **Use of `eval`?** | None. | ✅ | — |

## 4.  Best‑Practice Improvements

| Area | Action | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Shell Options** | Add `set -euo pipefail` + `IFS=$'\n\t'` at top. | Prevents silent errors, uses safe IFS. |
| **HTTP Error Checking** | Add `--fail` to curl or inspect `$?` and HTTP code. | Ensures API errors are surfaced. |
| **Debug Mode** | Add a separate flag (`OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG=1` should prefix all debug lines) and enforce that no secrets are part of log output. | Prevent accidental leakage. |
| **Command‑Line Option Parsing** | Use `getopts` or a minimal parser for functions that accept command‑line options (e.g., `ollama_app_turbo`) to avoid ambiguous input. | Reduces accidental misuse. |
| **Size Limits** | Define a constant `MAX_PROMPT_BYTES` and truncate or error out if exceeded. | Protect against DoS. |
| **SSRF Mitigation** | Validate `OLLAMA_HOST` matches a whitelist of allowed URLs (`http://localhost*`, `https://ollama.com`). | Prevent malicious setting of `OLLAMA_HOST`. |
| **Environment Secret Safeguards** | Provide `--hide-secrets` to `ollama_app_vars` or warn before printing `OLLAMA_AUTH`. | Minimizes accidental exposure. |
| **Error Handling** | Replace all direct `if !` with an explicit `case` or a helper that maps curl exit codes to meaningful messages. | Easier debugging. |
| **Code Comments** | Add a “Security‑Reassess” header to the top of the file indicating which sections have been audited. | For easier future reviews. |
| **Update `curl` and `jq` dependencies** | Use `command -v curl jq` early and fail fast if missing. | Prevent undefined behavior. |

## 5.  Summary of Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Information Leakage via Debug Logging** | Low – only if `OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG=1`. | Disable by default; document behaviour. |
| **SSRF via `OLLAMA_HOST`** | Medium – depends on malicious environment injection. | Input validation, whitelist. |
| **Command/Substitution Injection** | None – all payloads go through `jq`. | None. |
| **Secrets Exposure in `ollama_app_vars`** | Medium – when secrets are set. | Provide controlled output or warnings. |
| **Resource Exhaustion / DoS** | Medium – large prompts. | Add size limits. |
| **HTTP Error Masking** | Low – API errors are not flagged. | Add `--fail` / HTTP‑code handling. |

## 6.  Recommendations Checklist

- [ ] Add shell safety settings (`set -euo pipefail`, `IFS=$'\n\t'`).
- [ ] Switch `curl` to `--fail` or check HTTP status code.
- [ ] Tighten `OLLAMA_HOST` validation.
- [ ] Disable debug dumps by default; make optional.
- [ ] Provide a `--hide-secrets` or warn about printing `OLLAMA_AUTH`.
- [ ] Add configurable maximum prompt/message lengths.
- [ ] Refactor streaming loop to handle generic newline‑delimited input.
- [ ] Document all environment variables that can affect behaviour.
- [ ] Run the script through a static analysis tool (`shellcheck --severity=error`) and include its output.

## 7.  Final Verdict

The Ollama Bash Library is **mostly secure** with respect to shell‑level injection, command misuse, and privileged escalation.  The main concerns are around **information disclosure** (debug logs, environment display) and **potential SSRF** if the `OLLAMA_HOST` variable is set by an attacker.  Applying the above mitigations will harden the script against accidental misuse and make it easier to audit in the future.
