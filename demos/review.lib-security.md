The provided text appears to be a collection of Bash functions and their documentation for the Ollama Bash Lib, a library used for interacting with Ollama, an AI platform. The functions cover various aspects such as API calls, app management, messaging, model operations, process management, information display, and thinking mode.

Here's a brief overview of some key functions:

1. `ollama_api_*`: Functions to interact with the Ollama API (get, ping, post).
2. `ollama_app_*`: Functions for app-related tasks like installation, turbo mode, variables, version, JSON representation.
3. `ollama_chat_*`: Functions for sending and managing chat messages (text, JSON, stream, stream JSON).
4. `ollama_generate_*`: Functions for generating text or streams using Ollama models.
5. `ollama_lib_*`: Functions to display information about the library itself, list functions, and version.
6. `ollama_ps_*`: Functions for managing processes (list, JSON).
7. `ollama_show_*`: Functions for displaying various information or resources.
8. `ollama_thinking`: Function to manage thinking mode in Ollama interactions.

These functions are designed to simplify working with Ollama using Bash scripting, providing a user-friendly interface for common tasks. To use these functions, you would source the provided script and then call them with appropriate arguments. For example:

```bash
source ollama_bash_lib.sh
ollama_api_get "path/to/endpoint"
```
