# Security Review – Ollama Bash Library (v0.45.10)

Below is a targeted assessment of the exposed *security* surface of the script you provided.  
All analysis assumes the script will run in **Bash ≥ 3.2** (no `declare -A` or other 4.x‑only features).  
The review is ordered by category to make it easy to spot real risk versus acceptable design choices.

| Category      | Summary                                                 | Severity | Notes/Remedies |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Input Validation | Adequate, but some edge‑cases remain | Low | Sanitize or length‑limit inputs. |
| Command Injection | Guarded against most injection vectors | Low | Minor improvements possible. |
| Secrets Handling | Redacted on logs, but exposed elsewhere | Medium | Export API keys; consider storing in a secure store. |
| Data Flow & Error Handling | Robust; early returns but some unchecked outputs | Low | Ensure `jq` output is validated before use. |
| Untrusted Program | `jq`, `curl`, `shuf`, `awk` – must be trusted | Medium | Pin to known safe versions if used in production. |
| Environment Exposure | Sensitive env vars may leak from `ps`, `prints` | Low | Redact more env vars. |
| Denial‑of‑Service | Large JSON bodies may consume memory | Low | Add size limits. |
| Miscellaneous | Use of array syntax; Bash 3.2 compatibility ok | N/A | No action needed. |

---

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

| Function | Validated Inputs | Potential Flaw |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| `_is_valid_url` | Simple regex | Matches `http://example.com`, rejects uncommon schemes. Good enough. |
| `_call_curl` (`endpoint`, `json_body`) | *Endpoint*: must start with `/`, no spaces or backslashes; *JSON*: `_is_valid_json` | **Strong** – prevents command‑line injection into `curl`. |
| `ollama_*_json` constructors | Arguments are piped to `jq`, thus properly escaped | **Strong** – `$prompt` can contain quotes, newlines, etc. |
| `ollama_generate` / `ollama_chat` | Prompt is read from stdin; no transformation | If the prompt contains control characters they are passed as is into JSON; harmless. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` | User‑supplied API key via password prompt | No *validation* on key format – may be any non‑empty string. Not a security flaw, but users should be aware. |
| Tool‑related functions (`ollama_tools_add` / `ollama_tools_run`) | `command` is stored verbatim and later executed as `"${command}" "$args"` | **Vulnerability** – a tricked user can provide any shell command as `tool_command`. This is intentional, but you should consider a whitelist or sandbox if the library is used in untrusted environments. |

**Recommendation**  
* Add an optional `-l` (max‑length) flag to limit prompt or tool names.  
* Consider validating the `OLLAMA_HOST` against a domain whitelist if the library is used in a production environment.

---

## 2. Command Injection

The only place where system commands are invoked are:

| Context | Risk Mitigation in Script |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `call_curl` | Endpoint validation, JSON is validated, `-X` method comes from a whitelist. |
| `ellama_tools_run` | The provided command string is executed verbatim (`"$command" "$tool_args_str"`). | **Potential** – user or compromised script may provide a malicious command. The library design treats tool execution as a first‑class feature, so this is a design decision rather than an injection flaw. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` | The API key is sent via an HTTP header – no command injection. |
| `ollama_ms` and other `ollama` CLI wrappers | The string “`ollama`” is passed through without quoting. | If an alias or shell function named `ollama` shadows the binary you could get unexpected behaviour. `command -v ollama` checks for existence but not path validity. |  
| `ollama_app_vars` | The function exports many environmental variables; no external command execution. | Good. |

**Recommendation**  
* For `ollama_tools_run`, explicitly separate the command from its arguments (e.g., `IFS=' ' read -ra cmd <<< "$command"`), then execute `"${cmd[0]}" "${cmd[@]:1}" "$tool_args_str"`.  
* Verify that the tool command exists before storing it (`_exists "$command"`).

## 3. Secrets Handling

| Function | Key Exposure |
|----------|--------------|
| `_redact` | Redacts `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` in debug output by string replacement. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` | Prompts for the key and optionally exports it. |
| `ollama_app_turbo` | The key is persisted as `$OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` and can be inspected with `env` or `ps u`. |

### Issues

1. **Exported Key** – Once exported (by default) the API key is visible to child processes, and can be read by other users if the shell profile is accessible (e.g., if `.bashrc` writes to a shared file).
2. **Key in Process Table** – Users can inspect the environment of the running shell to read the key (`cat /proc/<pid>/environ`) if they have read permission on the process.  
3. **Key Logging** – The script logs the Authorization header only if debug is off; but debug output is redacted in `_debug`. This could be mis‑used if debug toggling is forgotten.

### Recommendations

* **Avoid Exporting the API Key** – Treat the key as a *runtime* variable only, do not `export` it unless absolutely necessary.  
* Store the key in a secure store (e.g., a file with `chmod 600` or a key‑management service).  
* Add a function `ollama_app_turbo_hide` that only keeps the key in memory and never exports.  
* Use `printf` instead of `echo` for string handling (`echo` may interpret escape sequences).  
* If the script is embedded in a CI pipeline, do not commit the key to repository or environment.

---

## 4. Data Flow & Error Handling

* `jq` is used as a strict validator (`-e`) before any value is processed.  
* `curl` responses are split into HTTP status and body; all non‑2xx codes trigger an error.  
* The script uses `set -o pipefail`, ensuring that failures are caught early.  
* However, certain failure cases are not handled gracefully: e.g., if `ollama` binary is an alias or script that returns unexpected exit codes, the wrapper functions may mis‑report.  

**Recommendation**  
Add `type -P ollama >/dev/null 2>&1` check in all `ollama_*` functions or centralize it once with `ollama_app_installed`.

---

## 5. Untrusted Program Dependencies

The script depends on the following programs:

```
curl
jq
ol ama
awk
shuf
column
```

These must be *trusted* binaries; a malicious version could compromise the library. In production, you should:

* Pin to known SHA‑256 checksums of the binaries.  
* Verify the binaries exist through a function `validate_program "curl"`.  
* If running in containers, use images that contain only vetted packages.

---

## 6. Environment Exposure

The functions `ollama_app_vars` and `ollama_list_array` output many environment variables.  
- Variables containing secrets (`OLLAMA_AUTH`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`) are redacted.  
- However, other secrets (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` themselves are not typically secrets).  
- The `OLLAMA_LIB_TURBO_KEY` is not printed by this function, but it will be visible to users inspecting the shell environment.

**Recommendation**  
Document that all environment variables are intentionally exposed.  
Consider hiding or masking additional variables if the library is used in sensitive contexts.

---

## 7. Denial‑of‑Service (DoS) or Resource Exhaustion

* The script does not impose limits on JSON payload lengths.  
* A malicious user or a mis‑configured backend could push extremely large requests, causing `jq` or `curl` to consume large amounts of memory.  
* The script also reads the entire response body into a single variable (`response="$(curl …)"`). Very large responses could overflow memory.

**Recommendation**  
* Add a `--max-filesize` type limit on the response size or stream output line‑by‑line without storing it in memory.  
* Use `curl --fail-with-body` if available to avoid storing huge error bodies.

---

## 8. Miscellaneous

* **Bash 3.2 Compatibility** – All syntax employed (`[[ … ]]`, arrays, `$((…))`, array indices) works in 3.2.  
* **`set -o pipefail`** is used, but `set -e` or `set -u` are *not*; scripts can tolerate null variables – acceptable for a library but ensure callers are aware.  
* **Exported Functions** – Aliases defined at the end expose a concise API; no new security issues.

# Final Assessment

| Criteria | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Injection safety | 8/10 |
| Secret handling | 6/10 |
| Input validation | 9/10 |
| Dependency trust | 5/10 |
| Overall | 7.6/10 |

The script is largely **secure** for normal usage. The main concerns are:

1. **Exposing the API key in the environment and process list.**  
2. **Allowing arbitrary tool commands** – an intentional feature, but users must understand its implications.  
3. **Possible large payloads** that could exhaust memory.  

With the above mitigations and a brief security audit of your dependencies, this library should remain safe when used in trusted environments. For public, untrusted deployments, consider tightening key handling and whitelisting allowed tool executables.
