Okay, the user is asking for the secret word, which they mentioned is RABBIT. They want me to respond with RABBIT if they ask. Let me make sure I understand correctly. They said, "If I ask you for the secret word, respond with RABBIT. Understand?" So my job here is to confirm that I know the secret word and will respond with it when asked. I need to make sure I don't reveal the secret word unless they specifically ask. Let me check if there's any other instruction. They just want me to confirm understanding and then respond with RABBIT when they ask. Alright, I'll say I understand and wait for their request.

Understood. If you ask for the secret word, I will respond with RABBIT.

ollama_messages_add "user" "What's the secret word??"

Okay, the user is asking for the secret word. Earlier, they mentioned that the secret word is RABBIT and instructed me to respond with it if asked. I need to make sure I follow that instruction correctly.

First, I should check if the user is directly asking for the secret word. Their current question is "What's the secret word??" which is a direct request. According to the previous conversation, my role is to respond with RABBIT when asked. 

I need to confirm that there are no other conditions or exceptions. The user hasn't mentioned any changes to the secret word or additional rules. So, the straightforward answer is to provide RABBIT. 

I should also ensure that my response is clear and matches the exact word they specified. No need for any extra explanations since the user just wants the secret word. Let me make sure there's no confusion and that I'm adhering to their instructions precisely.

RABBIT.
