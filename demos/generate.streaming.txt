<think>
Alright, so I need to describe a rabbit using three short sentences. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider the key characteristics of rabbits that make them unique and recognizable. They are small animals known for their speed, but more importantly, they have distinctive features like long ears and strong hind legs which help them jump quickly. Also, their fur comes in various colors, which adds to their charm.

Next, I want to highlight not just their physical traits but also their behavior or personality. Rabbits are often seen as gentle and curious, which makes them popular as pets. They interact with humans in a way that's both friendly and playful, so mentioning this could add depth to the description.

Lastly, I should think about how rabbits fit into different contexts. Theyâ€™re common in stories and symbols, like the Easter Bunny, which adds cultural significance. This shows their importance beyond just being pets or wild animals.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each sentence is concise and covers a different aspect: physical traits, behavior, and cultural relevance.
