<think>
Okay, the user wants me to describe a rabbit in three short sentences. Let me think about the key aspects of a rabbit.

First, their physical features. Rabbits have fluffy ears, which are important. Maybe mention the color, like brown or gray. Then their body shape, compact and agile. They have a short tail, which is a common feature. 

Next, their behavior. They're curious and agile, which are important traits. Maybe add something about their movement, like hopping or running. Also, their habitat, like grasslands or forests. 

Wait, the user specified three sentences. Let me make sure each sentence covers a different aspect. First, physical description: ears, color, body shape, tail. Second, behavior: curiosity, agility, movement. Third, habitat. That should cover it. Need to keep each sentence concise. Avoid any technical terms. Make it natural and descriptive. Check for clarity and flow. Alright, that should work.

A rabbit has fluffy, brown ears and a compact body, often with a short tail, ideal for quick movement. It is curious and agile, darting across grasslands with nimble jumps. Its habitat includes open spaces like meadows or forests, where it feeds on vegetation.
