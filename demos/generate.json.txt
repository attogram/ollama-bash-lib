Okay, first, rabbits are animals, right? They're part of the mammals family. Maybe I can mention something about their structure or behavior.\n\nI remember that rabbits have four legs and some colorful fur. Their body is roundish with small ears on either side. The eyes are tiny but big enough to see, and they can hop around quickly. Their coat has patterns, maybe spots? Oh, right, the Fibonacci sequence in their pattern! That's interesting.\n\nWait, let me think about their diet. Rabbits eat grass and small plants, live in hutches or burrows, and have babies called litters of rabbits. So I should include that. Also, they're social animals; there are different breeds like grey and white. Maybe mention that they can be found anywhere, like on plantations.\n\nPutting it all together, I want to make sure each sentence covers a different aspect: structure, behavior, appearance, diet, location, and variety of types. That way, the description is comprehensive and covers various features of rabbits.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRabbits are four-legged animals belonging to the mammals family. They have round bodies with small ears, tiny but big eyes, and a striped coat following the Fibonacci sequence. Rabbits hop quickly, often living in hutches or burrows. Their diet includes grass and small plants, and they can have litters of rabbits. While some are large gray ones, others may look white or grey. Rabbits are social animals found everywhere.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,74785,264,38724,304,220,18,2805,22870,151645,151648,198,71486,11,773,358,1184,311,7512,264,38724,304,2326,2805,22870,13,88190,11,1380,653,358,1191,30,35439,11,1156,11,69144,525,9898,11,1290,30,2379,2299,949,315,279,55569,2997,13,10696,358,646,6286,2494,911,862,5944,476,7709,382,40,6099,429,69144,614,3040,14201,323,1045,33866,18241,13,10964,2487,374,4778,812,448,2613,24230,389,2987,3108,13,576,6414,525,13673,714,2409,3322,311,1490,11,323,807,646,7446,2163,6157,13,10964,22875,702,12624,11,7196,18773,30,8670,11,1290,11,279,79683,8500,304,862,5383,0,2938,594,7040,382,14190,11,1077,752,1744,911,862,9968,13,35724,11516,8180,16359,323,2613,10779,11,3887,304,75879,8528,476,7795,1811,11,323,614,23920,2598,326,28063,315,69144,13,2055,358,1265,2924,429,13,7281,11,807,2299,3590,9898,26,1052,525,2155,57145,1075,19780,323,4158,13,10696,6286,429,807,646,387,1730,12379,11,1075,389,6008,804,382,97904,432,678,3786,11,358,1366,311,1281,2704,1817,11652,14521,264,2155,12893,25,5944,11,7709,11,11094,11,9968,11,3728,11,323,8045,315,4494,13,2938,1616,11,279,4008,374,15817,323,14521,5257,4419,315,69144,624,151649,271,49,370,11516,525,3040,94264,9898,32052,311,279,55569,2997,13,2379,614,4778,12866,448,2613,24230,11,13673,714,2409,6414,11,323,264,67590,22875,2701,279,79683,8500,13,35724,11516,7446,6157,11,3545,5382,304,75879,8528,476,7795,1811,13,10964,9968,5646,16359,323,2613,10779,11,323,807,646,614,326,28063,315,69144,13,5976,1045,525,3460,17545,6174,11,3800,1231,1401,4158,476,19780,13,35724,11516,525,3590,9898,1730,16852,13],"total_duration":6648147417,"load_duration":1200765708,"prompt_eval_count":11,"prompt_eval_duration":166848667,"eval_count":325,"eval_duration":5279735667}
