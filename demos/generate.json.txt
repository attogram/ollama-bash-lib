  "response": "<think>\nThe user asked for a description of a rabbit in just three short sentences, so I need to be concise and hit the key points without overwhelming them. First, recall what rabbits are known for: they're small mammals with long ears, soft fur, and often associated with being cute or fast. The query specifies \"short sentences,\" which probably means simple, clear language—no jargon—and each sentence should stand alone as a complete thought.\n\nNow, assessing the user's scenario, it seems casual; maybe they're testing my ability to summarize quickly or just need a quick fun fact for something like a school project or conversation. Their actual needs are straightforward: basic facts about appearance and behavior. But deeper down, there might be unspoken needs, like wanting to learn why rabbits are iconic in culture—perhaps for relaxation, education, or sparking interest in animals.\n\nTo craft the response, I should aim for three sentences covering essentials without fluff. Start with physical traits (e.g., size and ears), then movement or habits (hopping), and finally a cultural aspect (being symbols of innocence). This keeps it balanced and engaging while being brief.\n</think>\nA rabbit is typically a small mammal known for its long, powerful ears that can twitch alertly. It moves with characteristic hops on hind legs covered in soft fur, often white or brown depending on the species. Rabbits are frequently seen as symbols of innocence and grace, particularly in folklore and children's stories.",
