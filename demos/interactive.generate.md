>>> The secret word is RABBIT. Understand?

3 words describing Bash
Yes, I understand! The secret word is **RABBIT**. (It's a play on words - "rabbit" is spelled with a "b" instead of a "r" at the beginning!) Got it! ð Is there anything else I need to know or do with this information? Perhaps you want me to:* **Remember it?** (I will!)* **Use it in a sentence?** (e.g., "The secret word is RABBIT, so don't tell anyone!")* **Test me?** (e.g., "What's the secret word?")Let me know! 

>>> 
What is the secret word?
Here are 3 words to describe Bash:*   **Powerful:** Bash is incredibly versatile and can automate complex tasks.*   **Ubiquitous:** It's the default shell on most Linux and macOS systems.*   **Flexible:** Highly customizable with scripting and aliases.
