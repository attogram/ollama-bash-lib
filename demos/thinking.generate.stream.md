# <thinking>
# The user wants a list of 10 things about bash, one per line. So just give a list, each line a distinct thing about bash. Should be straightforward. No disallowed content. Provide list.1. Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell,” a successor to the original Unix Bourne shell.  2. It is the default command interpreter on most Linux distributions and macOS.  3. Bash supports command-line editing with Emacs‑ and Vi‑style keybindings.  4. It includes built‑in scripting features like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.  5. Bash can perform wildcard (globbing) expansion, such as `*.txt` to match files.  6. It supports command substitution using backticks `` `cmd` `` or `$(cmd)`.  7. Bash provides history management, allowing recall of previous commands with the up arrow or `history`.  8. It includes powerful redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`, `2>&1`, etc.) for input/output handling.  9. Bash can source other scripts or configuration files using the `source` or `.` command.  10. It offers programmable completion, enabling custom tab‑completion for commands and arguments.
