#### The user asks: \"list 10 things about bash, 1 per line\". Straightforward: provide 10 bullet points or lines, each a thing about bash. No disallowed content. Provide simple answer.1. Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell,” a successor to the original Bourne shell (sh).  
2. It is the default command‑line interpreter on most Linux distributions and macOS.  
3. Bash supports both interactive use and scripting, allowing users to automate tasks.  
4. It includes features like command history, tab completion, and programmable completion.  
5. Bash provides powerful control structures (if, for, while, case) for writing complex scripts.  
6. It supports variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic evaluation.  
7. Bash can execute pipelines and redirections, connecting multiple commands together.  
8. It includes built‑in commands (e.g., `cd`, `echo`, `read`, `printf`) that run without spawning external processes.  
9. Bash scripts can define functions, enabling code reuse and modularity.  
10. The shell’s configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `/etc/bash.bashrc`) customize the environment and behavior.
