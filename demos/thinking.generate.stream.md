# <thinking>
# The user wants a list of 10 things about Bash, one per line. Likely they want bullet points or just lines. Provide a list. Ensure no disallowed content. It's a straightforward request.- Bash is the Bourne Again SHell, a Unix shell and command‑language interpreter.  - It is the default login shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.  - Bash supports command history and line editing via readline (arrow keys, Ctrl‑R, etc.).  - It includes powerful scripting features such as loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays.  - Bash can perform job control, allowing background processes and foreground/ background switching (Ctrl‑Z, `bg`, `fg`).  - It provides extensive globbing and pathname expansion (e.g., `*.txt`, `{a,b}`).  - Bash includes built‑in arithmetic with integer operations and can use `$(( expression ))`.  - It supports process substitution and command substitution using `` `...` `` or `$(...)`.  - Bash can source other scripts or configuration files with the `source` (or `.`) command.  - It offers customizable prompts and environment variables through the `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files.
