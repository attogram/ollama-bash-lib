# <thinking>
# The user wants us to produce a list of 10 things about bash, 1 per line. That's simple. Probably bullet points or just numbered. Probably minimal formatting. Ok. We'll comply.1. Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.  2. It supports scripting with variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.  3. Bash allows command substitution using `$(...)` or backticks `` `...` ``.  4. It features globbing and wildcard pattern matching for file selection.  5. Bash can auto‑complete commands and filenames using the `Tab` key.  6. It maintains a command history that can be searched with `Ctrl+R`.  7. Bash can be configured with environment variables such as `$PATH`.  8. It supports job control, letting users suspend (`Ctrl+Z`) and resume jobs.  9. Bash can read and write configuration files like `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.  10. It provides an extensive set of built‑in utilities (e.g., `cd`, `echo`, `test`).
