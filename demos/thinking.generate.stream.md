# <thinking>
# The user wants 10 things about Bash, 1 per line. Likely a list format, each line a fact or feature. Provide simple list.1. Bash stands for “Bourne Again SHell,” a successor to the original Unix Bourne shell.  2. It is the default login shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.  3. Bash supports command-line editing with Emacs and Vi key bindings.  4. It includes powerful scripting features like functions, arrays, and associative arrays.  5. The shell can perform job control, allowing you to suspend, resume, and background processes.  6. Bash provides built‑in arithmetic expansion for integer calculations.  7. It supports wildcard (globbing) patterns such as `*`, `?`, and `[]` for filename matching.  8. The `[[ … ]]` conditional expression offers more flexible testing than `[ … ]`.  9. Bash can source other scripts with the `source` (or `.`) command to reuse functions and variables.  10. It includes advanced redirection operators (e.g., `>&`, `>>`, `<>`, `|&`) for manipulating input and output streams.
